## Independent auditor's report

To the Shareholders of AutoCanada Inc.

## Our opinion

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of AutoCanada Inc. and its subsidiaries (together, the Company) as at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS).

## What we have audited

The Company's consolidated financial statements comprise:

- the consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021;
- the consolidated statements of financial position as at December 31, 2022 and 2021;
- the consolidated statements of changes in equity for the years then ended;
- the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years then ended; and
- the notes to the consolidated financial statements, which include significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.


## Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

## Independence

We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in Canada. We have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

|  Key audit matters | |
| --- | --- |
|  Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. | |
|  Key audit matter | |
|  Impairment recoveries of intangible assets in the Canadian Operations segment | |
|  Refer to note 3 – Significant accounting policies, note 5 – Critical accounting estimates and note 19 – Goodwill and intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements. | |
|  The Company had intangible assets of $659,261 thousand as at December 31, 2022, of which a portion pertains to the Canadian Operations segment. Management performs an impairment test at least annually, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped as cash generating units (CGU), the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows. Impairments are recorded when the recoverable amounts of CGUs are less than their carrying amounts. The recoverable amount of each CGU is based on the greater of fair value less cost to dispose (FVLCD) and value in use (VIU). Impairment losses, other than those relating to goodwill, are evaluated for potential reversals of impairment when events or changes in circumstances warrant such considerations. | |
|  Under the FVLCD approach, fair value is calculated based on an applicable multiple applied to projected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). In arriving at the FVLCD, management considers projected EBITDA determined through projected operating margins, growth rates and EBITDA | |

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Our approach to addressing the matter included the following procedures, among others:

- Tested how management determined the recoverable amount for certain CGUs in the Canadian Operations segment for which events or changes in circumstances have been identified, which included the following:
- Tested the appropriateness of the approaches used and the mathematical accuracy of FVLCD and VIU calculations.
- Tested the reasonableness of the projected EBITDA through projected operating margins and growth rates applied by management in the applicable calculations by comparing them to the budget, management's strategic plans approved by the Board, available third party published economic data and the results historically achieved by the respective CGUs.
- Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge in the field of valuation assisted in testing the reasonableness of the discount rates applied by management based on available data of comparable companies and in testing the reasonableness of the EBITDA multiples by comparing to market data, as well as assessing the valuation methodologies used.

|  multiples as significant assumptions. Under the VIU approach the discounted cash flow (DCF) method is used, which involves projecting cash flows and converting them into a present value equivalent through discounting. Significant assumptions used in the VIU approach include projected operating margins, growth rates and discount rates. Based on the impairment assessment, management recognized impairment recoveries of $8,691 thousand in the Canadian Operations segment allocated to intangible assets.We consider this a key audit matter due to (i) the significance of the intangible asset balances and (ii) the significant judgment made by management in determining the recoverable amounts of the CGU’s, including the use of significant assumptions. This has resulted in a high degree of subjectivity and audit effort in performing audit procedures to test the significant assumptions. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge in the field of valuation assisted us in performing our procedures. | - Tested the accuracy and completeness of underlying data used in the FVLCD and VIU calculations. - Tested the disclosures made in the consolidated financial statements, including the sensitivity of the significant assumptions used.  |
|  Valuation of indefinite-life intangible assets related to franchise rights acquired | Our approach to addressing the matter included the following procedures, among others:  |
|  Refer to note 3 – Significant accounting policies, note 5 – Critical accounting estimates and note 13 – Business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements.During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company completed the acquisitions of substantially all of the assets or shares of various dealerships for total consideration of $134,880 thousand. The fair values of the identifiable assets acquired included $83,085 thousand in intangible assets relating to indefinite-life franchise rights associated with the respective dealerships.

|  We considered this a key audit matter due to the significant judgment applied by management in estimating the fair values of the intangible assets relating to indefinite-life franchise rights, including the development of significant assumptions. This, in turn, led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the significant assumptions developed by management. The audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge in the field of valuation. | - Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge in the field of valuation assisted in evaluating the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings method and the discounted cash flow models and in testing the reasonableness of the discount rates.  |

## Other information

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

## Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the consolidated financial statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, and for such internal control as management determines is

necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.

# Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to

the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Company to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Richard Probert.

## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
(in thousands of Canadian dollars except for share and per share amounts)

## 1 General information

AutoCanada Inc. ("AutoCanada" or the "Company") is incorporated in Alberta, Canada with common shares listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX") under the symbol of "ACQ". The business of AutoCanada, held in its subsidiaries, is the operation of franchised automobile dealerships and related businesses in the Provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and in the State of Illinois in the United States. The Company offers a diversified range of automotive products and services, including new vehicles, used vehicles, vehicle leasing, vehicle parts, vehicle maintenance and collision repair services, extended service contracts, vehicle protection products, after-market products and auction services. The Company also arranges financing and insurance for vehicle purchases by its customers through third party finance and insurance sources. The address of its registered office is 200, 15511123 Avenue NW, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, T5V 0C3.

## 2 Basis of presentation

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") and Canadian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") as set out in the CPA Canada Handbook - Accounting ("CPA Handbook").
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. The areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are described in Note 5.
These consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on March 1, 2023.

## 3 Significant accounting policies

The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are as follows:

## Basis of measurement

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities to fair value, including derivative instruments and redemption liabilities.

## Principles of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of AutoCanada and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Company has control. For accounting purposes, control is established by an investor when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The Company uses judgment in determining the entities that it controls and therefore consolidates. Judgment is applied in determining whether the Company controls the entities in which it does not have full ownership rights. Most often, judgment involves reviewing contractual rights to determine if rights are participating (giving power over one entity) or protective rights (protecting the Company's interest without giving it power). Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date control is transferred to the Company, and are no longer consolidated on the date control ceases.
Non-controlling interests represent equity interests in subsidiaries owned by outside parties. The share of net assets of subsidiaries attributable to non-controlling interests is presented as a component of equity. Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses, and gains or losses on transactions are eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Company.

# Business combinations 

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting when the acquired set of activities and assets meet the definition of a business and control is transferred to the Company. This involves recognizing identifiable assets (including intangible assets not previously recognized by the acquiree) and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) of acquired businesses at fair value at the acquisition date. The excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the acquisition cost is less than the fair value of the net assets acquired, the fair value of the net assets is reassessed and any remaining difference is recognized directly in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.
Contingent consideration is classified as either equity or a financial liability. Any subsequent change to the fair value of contingent consideration is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

## Non-controlling interests

Non-controlling interests are measured initially at their proportionate share of the acquiree's or entity's identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition or date the interest was granted. Certain arrangements contain a vesting component where the non-controlling interest vests over a specified period. Changes in the Company's interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
Non-controlling interests are issued in subsidiaries of the Company at their proportionate share at the date of issuance. Subsequent measurement of the carrying value of the non-controlling interests is the value at acquisition plus the non-controlling interest portion of profit and loss, as governed by the individual agreements.

## Revenue recognition

(a) New and Used Vehicles

The Company sells new and used vehicles at its franchised dealerships, used dealerships, and related businesses. The transaction price for a vehicle sale is determined with the customer at the time of sale. Customers often trade in their own vehicle and apply the value against the purchase price of a new or used vehicle. The trade-in vehicle is considered non-cash consideration and is measured at fair value, based on external and internal market data, and applied toward the contract price for the purchased vehicle.
When a vehicle is sold, control is transferred at a point in time upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer, which is generally at time of sale. The Company does not directly finance customers' vehicle purchases or leases, however, in many cases, third party financing is arranged for the sale or lease of vehicles to its customers in exchange for a fee paid to the Company by the third party financial institution. The Company receives payment directly from the customer at the time of sale or from the third party financial institution (referred to as contracts-in-transit or vehicle receivables, which are part of the Company's receivables from contracts with customers) within a short period of time following the sale.
(b) Parts, service, and collision repair

The Company sells parts and services related to customer-paid repairs and maintenance, repairs and maintenance under manufacturer warranties and extended service contracts, and collision-related repairs.
Each automotive repair and maintenance service is a single performance obligation that includes both the parts and labour associated with the service. Payment for automotive service work is typically due upon completion of the service, which is generally completed within a short period of time from contract inception. The transaction price for automotive repair and maintenance services is based on the parts used, the number of labour hours applied, and standardized hourly labour rates. The Company satisfies its performance obligations, transfers control, and recognizes revenue over time for repair and maintenance services because it is creating an asset with no alternative use and has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.
The transaction price for retail counter parts sales is determined at the time of sale based on the quantity and price of each product purchased. Payment is typically due at the time of sale, or within a short period of time following the sale. Control is generally considered to transfer at the point of sale or when the products are shipped, which typically occurs the same day as or within a few days of the sale.

(c) Finance and insurance commissions and fees

The Company arranges financing for customers through various financial institutions and receives a commission from the lender based on the difference between the interest rate charged to the customer and the interest rate set by the financing institution, or a flat fee.
The Company also receives commissions for facilitating the sale of third-party insurance products to customers, including credit and life insurance policies and extended service contracts. These commissions are recorded as revenue at the time the customer enters into the contract and the Company is entitled to the commission. The Company is not the obligor under any of these contracts. In the case of finance contracts, a customer may fail to pay their contract, thereby terminating the contract. Customers may also terminate extended service contracts, which are fully paid at purchase, and become eligible for refunds of unused premiums. In these circumstances, a portion of the commissions the Company receives may be charged back to the Company based on the terms of the contracts. These chargebacks are a form of variable consideration, and the Company only recognizes commission revenue at the estimated amount of consideration to which it ultimately expects to be entitled. This estimate is based on historical chargeback experience arising from similar contracts, including the impact of refinance and default rates on retail finance contracts and cancellation rates on extended service contracts and other insurance products.
For the majority of finance and insurance product sales, the Company's performance obligation is to arrange for the provision of goods or services by another party. This performance obligation is satisfied when the finance and insurance product is delivered to the end-customer, generally at the time of the vehicle sale. As an agent, revenue is recognized as the net amount retained after paying the third party provider for the goods or services that party is responsible for fulfilling.

# Finance income 

Finance income comprises of finance lease income and interest income on short term deposits. Finance income is recognized in profit or loss as they accrue using the effective interest method.

## Taxation

(a) Deferred tax

Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated statements of financial position. Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, and which are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax liabilities:

- are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences; and
- are not recognized on temporary differences that arise from goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes.
Deferred tax assets:
- are recognized to the extent it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilized; and
- are reviewed at the end of the reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognized in respect of temporary differences that arise on initial recognition of assets and liabilities acquired other than in a business combination.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of investments in subsidiaries where the company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
(b) Current tax

Current tax expense is based on the results for the period as adjusted for items that are not taxable or not deductible. Current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that were enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. Provisions are established where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

# Manufacturer incentives and other rebates 

Various incentives from manufacturers are received based on achieving certain objectives, such as specified sales volume targets. These incentives are typically based on units sold to retail or fleet customers. These manufacturer incentives are recognized as a reduction of new vehicle cost of sales when earned, generally at the latter of the time the related vehicles are sold or upon attainment of the particular program goals.
Manufacturer rebates to the Company's dealerships and assistance for floorplan interest are reflected as a reduction in the carrying value of each vehicle purchased by the Company. These incentives are recognized as a reduction to the cost of sales as the related vehicles are sold.
Manufacturer advertising rebates that are reimbursements of costs associated with specific advertising expenses are earned in accordance with the respective manufacturers' reimbursement-based advertising assistance programs, which is typically after the corresponding advertising expenses have been incurred, and are reflected as a reduction in advertising expense included in administrative costs as an operating expense in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

## Financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. All financial instruments are required to be measured at fair value on initial recognition. The Company's own credit risk and the credit risk of the counter party are taken into consideration in determining the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities.
Financial assets are recognized on the settlement date, which is the date on which the asset is delivered to or by the Company. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the instruments have expired or were transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
The Company's financial assets, including cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables are measured at amortized cost. The contractual cash flows received from these financial assets are solely payments of principal and interest and are held within a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows. The financial assets are initially recognized at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
The Company's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, revolving floorplan facilities, vehicle repurchase obligations, current and long-term indebtedness, derivative financial instruments, redemption liabilities and lease liabilities. Financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost except for redemption liabilities, non-hedge interest swaps, contingent consideration and embedded derivative, which are carried at fair value through profit or loss. Transaction costs associated with the establishment of indebtedness or amendment of loan facilities are recorded against proceeds and recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income over the term of the borrowings using the effective interest rate.

## Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, highly liquid investment grade short-term investments with maturities of three months or less and other liquid deposits held with financial institutions.

## Trade and other receivables

Trade and other receivables are amounts due from customers, financial institutions and suppliers that arise from providing services or sale of goods in the ordinary course of business. Trade and other receivables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The Company applies the simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses ("ECL"), which uses a lifetime expected credit loss allowance for all trade receivables. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income within operating expenses.
When a trade and other receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for trade and other receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

# Inventories 

New, used and demonstrator vehicle inventories are recorded at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost determined on a specific item basis. Parts and accessories inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Inventories of parts and accessories are accounted for using the "weighted-average cost" method.
In determining net realizable value for new vehicles, the Company primarily considers the age of the vehicles along with the timing of annual and model changeovers. For used vehicles, the Company considers recent market data and trends such as loss histories along with the current age of the inventory. Parts inventories are primarily assessed considering excess quantity and continued usefulness of the part. The risk of loss in value related to parts inventories is minimized since excess or obsolete parts can generally be returned to the manufacturer.

## Property and equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial year-end. Land is not depreciated. Other than as noted below, depreciation of property and equipment is provided for over the estimated useful life of the assets on a declining balance basis at the following annual rates:

Machinery and equipment $20 \%$
Furniture, fixtures and other $20 \%$
Company and lease vehicles $30 \%$
Computer equipment $30 \%$

Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the buildings ranging from 10 to 45 years. Useful lives are determined based on independent appraisals.
The useful life of leasehold improvements is determined to be the lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvement. Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the useful life of the asset.
Depreciation of leased vehicles is based on a straight-line depreciation of the difference between the cost and the estimated residual value at the end of the lease over the term of the lease. Leased vehicle residual values are regularly reviewed to determine whether depreciation rates are reasonable.

## Intangible assets and goodwill

(a) Intangible assets

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination consist of rights under franchise agreements ("dealer agreements") and certifications with automobile manufacturers. The Company has determined that dealer agreements and certifications will continue to contribute to cash flows indefinitely and, therefore, have indefinite lives due to the following reasons:

- Specific dealer agreements continue indefinitely by their terms; and
- Specific dealer agreements and certifications have limited terms, but are routinely renewed without substantial cost to the Company.
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. When acquired in a business combination, the cost is determined in connection with the purchase price allocation based on their respective fair values at the acquisition date. The fair value is determined based on the multi-period excess earnings method, using the discounted cash flow model. When market value is not readily determinable, cost is determined using generally accepted valuation methods based on revenues, costs, or other appropriate criteria.
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Intangible assets with finite lives amortized over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortization period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortization expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in the statement of profit or loss in the expense category that is consistent with the function of the intangible assets.

(b) Research and development costs

Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditures on an individual project are recognized as an intangible asset when the Company can demonstrate:

- The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that the asset will be available for use or sale;
- Its intention to complete and its ability and intention to use or sell the asset;
- How the asset will generate future economic benefits;
- The availability of resources to complete the asset; and
- The ability to measure reliably the expenditure during development.

Following initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the asset is carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization of the asset begins when development is complete, and the asset is available for use. It is amortized over the period of expected future benefit. Amortization is recorded in operating expenses. During the period of development, the asset is tested for impairment annually.
(c) Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquirees, and the acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquirees over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

# Impairment 

Impairments are recorded when the recoverable amounts of assets are less than their carrying amounts. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to dispose or its value in use. Impairment losses, other than those relating to goodwill, are evaluated for potential reversals of impairment when events or changes in circumstances warrant such consideration.
(a) Non-financial assets

The carrying values of non-financial assets with finite lives, such as property and equipment and right-of-use assets, are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped as cash generating units (CGUs), the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
(b) Intangible assets and goodwill

The carrying values of all intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Additionally, the carrying values of identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill are tested annually for impairment. Specifically:

- Our dealer agreements and certifications with indefinite lives are subject to an annual impairment assessment. For purposes of impairment testing, the fair value of the Company's dealer agreements is determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow approach and earnings multiple approach.
- For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to CGUs based on the level at which management monitors it, which is not higher than an operating segment before aggregation. Goodwill is allocated to those CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.


## Trade and other payables

Trade and other payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business. Trade and other payables are recognized initially at fair value, subsequently measured at amortized cost, and classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year.
Provisions represent liabilities for which the amount or timing is uncertain. Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expected expenditures to settle the obligation using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in provisions due to passage of time is recognized as interest expense.

# Leases 

(a) The Company as a lessee

The Company leases various properties. Lease agreements range from 1 to 20 years but may have extension options as described below. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions.
The Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Company. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.
The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate, amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees, the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and payments of penalties for terminating the lease if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be determined, or the Company's incremental borrowing rate.
Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability and any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, any initial direct costs, and restoration costs.
Payments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Lowvalue assets comprise IT equipment and office furniture.
After the commencement date of a lease contract, remeasurements of a lease liability result from either a lease modification or reassessment. A change in the scope of a lease contract, or the consideration for a lease, that was not part of its original terms and conditions is considered a lease modification. A lease modification is assessed to determine whether it meets the criteria of a separate lease that would require a separate right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability at the effective date of the modification. If the lease modification is not a separate lease, the Company remeasures the lease liability to reflect changes to the lease payments and adjusts the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset. If the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has already been reduced to zero, the Company recognizes the remaining amount of the remeasurement in the determination of net earnings (loss). A lease reassessment takes place when there are changes in the lease payments based on contractual clauses included in the original contract. For lease reassessments, the lease liability is remeasured to reflect changes to the lease payments and adjusts the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset. If the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has already been reduced to zero, the Company recognizes the remaining amount of the remeasurement in the determination of profit or loss.
(b) The Company as a lessor

Lease obligations are classified as either operating or finance, based on the substance of the transaction at inception of the lease. Classification is reassessed if the terms of the lease are changed.
(i) Finance leases

Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred are classified as finance leases.
When assets are leased out under a finance lease, the present value of the lease payments is recognized as a receivable. The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is recognized as unearned finance income.
The method for allocating gross earnings to accounting periods is referred to as the "actuarial method". The actuarial method allocates rentals between finance income and repayment of capital in each accounting period in such a way that finance income will emerge as a constant rate of return on the lessor's net investment in the lease.

(ii) Operating leases

Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership is retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
When assets are leased out under an operating lease, the asset is included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position based on the nature of the asset. Lease income on operating leases is recognized over the term of the lease on a straight-line basis.

# Redemption liabilities 

The potential cash payments related to put options issued by the Company over the equity of subsidiary companies are accounted for as financial liabilities when such options are to be settled in cash or a variable number of shares. The amount that may become payable under the option on exercise is initially recognized at fair value within redemption liabilities with a corresponding charge directly to equity attributable to AutoCanada shareholders or share-based compensation. Subsequently, if the Company revises its estimates, the carrying amount of the redemption liability is adjusted and the adjustment will be recognized as income or expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Options that are not exercisable for at least one year from the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position date are presented as non-current liabilities.

## Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. Where any group company purchases the Company's equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the Company's shareholders until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such ordinary shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company's shareholders.

## Dividends

Dividends on common shares are recognized in the Company's consolidated financial statements in the period the dividends are declared by the Company's Board of Directors.

## Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the treasury stock method, which assumes that the cash that would be received on the exercise of options is applied to purchase shares at the average price during the period and that the difference between the number of shares issued on the exercise of options and the number of shares obtainable under this computation, on a weighted average basis, is added to the number of shares outstanding. Antidilutive options are not considered in computing diluted earnings per share.

## Share-based payments

The Company operates a number of share-based compensation plans for the benefit of certain employees and Company directors, as described in Note 28.
The accounting for a share-based payment plan is based on whether the arrangement is classified as equitysettled or cash-settled. Equity-settled arrangements are those in which the Company receives services as consideration for its own equity instruments. Cash-settled arrangements arise where the Company pays the employee cash amounts based on the value of the Company's shares.
The fair value of equity-settled awards is recognized as an expense over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity or redemption liabilities. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options at the grant date.

## Foreign currency translation

The financial results of the dealerships that operate in the United States (U.S.) are translated from the functional currency (USD) into the reporting currency (CAD) upon consolidation. Assets and liabilities have been translated to the reporting currency (CAD) using the exchange rates in effect on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position dates. Revenue and expense accounts are translated using the average exchange rate during the period. The cumulative translation adjustments associated with the net assets of foreign subsidiaries are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign operations are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.

# Derivative financial instruments 

Derivatives are recognized initially at fair value on the date of contract inception and are subsequently remeasured to current fair value at the end of each reporting period. The accounting for subsequent changes in fair value depends on whether the instrument is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Company currently designates certain derivatives as hedges of the interest rate cash flow risk associated with the cash flows of variable rate loans, and does not hold any derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Company documents the economic relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of qualifying hedging derivatives is recognized as a reserve within equity. The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in profit or loss. The periodic net settlement of the interest rate swap is recognized in profit or loss within finance costs at the same time as the interest expense on the hedged borrowings.
Upon the expiry, sale, or termination of a hedging instrument, any cumulative deferred gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging remain in equity until the original hedged transactions occur.
Further information on the Company's risk management and hedge accounting is presented in Note 24.
Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized immediately in profit or loss and are included in Revenue and Finance costs, as disclosed in Note 24.
The full fair value of a derivative instrument is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is greater than one year.

## Segment reporting

Operating segments are components of an entity that engage in business activities from which they earn revenues and incur expenses, the operations for which can be clearly distinguished and for which the operating results are regularly reviewed by a chief operating decision maker to make resource allocation decisions and to assess performance.
The Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is identified as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and will serve as the function of the CODM. The CEO is responsible for allocating resources and assessing the performance of each dealership. In the absence of the CEO, the Executive Chairman will serve the function of the CODM. Supporting the CODM will be the President, Canadian Operations and the Vice President, U.S. Operations, both of whom report to the CODM. As each of these individuals, with support from their respective management teams, report to the CODM, the Company will report segmented information by Canadian Operations and U.S. Operations. Each reportable operating segment is comprised of retail automobile dealerships, which have been aggregated based on their economic similarities.
The Company's CODM measures the performance of each operating segment based on operating profit, which is defined as income before income taxes, net finance costs and other income (expense). The segmented information is set out in Note 35.

## Government assistance

Government assistance received by the Company for the purpose of subsidizing specific expenses is recognized in profit or loss on a systematic basis in the periods in which the expenses are recognized, as further described in Note 8.

## 4 New and amended accounting standards issued

Accounting standards and amendments issued and adopted in 2022

## Property, Plant and Equipment - Proceeds before Intended Use (Amendments to IAS 16)

Under IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, it is required that the cost of an asset includes any costs attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for the asset to be capable for operating in its intended manner. Testing that asset is functioning properly is one of those costs.
In May 2020, the IASB published an amendment to IFRS 16 that prohibits deducting any proceeds from selling items produced while bringing that asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management from the cost of an item of property, plant, and equipment. This amendment states that an entity should recognize the proceeds from selling such items, and the cost of producing those items, in profit or loss. Further, an entity will use IAS 2 inventories as guidance on how to measure the cost of such items and specifically deprecation of the asset should not be included as the asset is not ready for intended use.

The amendment requires separate disclosure in the statement of comprehensive income or loss for the amounts of proceeds and costs relating to items produced that are not an output of the entity's ordinary activities.
This amendment can have a significant impact on entities where items are produced and sold as part of bringing an item of property, plant, and equipment to the location and condition required for its intended use. The Company has assessed the adoption of this standard to have no material impact to the assets currently held and under the scope of IAS 16.

# Reference to Conceptual Framework (Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations) 

The IASB published minor amendments to IFRS 3 to update the references for what constitutes as asset or a liability in a business combination in the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting to a current version issued in March 2018, without significantly changing its requirements.
An amendment was included to add an exception to the recognition principle under IFRS 3 for liabilities and contingent liabilities that fall under the scope of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets or IFRIC 21 Levies rather than the 2018 Conceptual Framework previously used. Under this new exception, an entity will not recognize some liabilities when applying IAS 37 rather than would have been recognized under IFRS 3 and therefore ensuring that certain liabilities do not need to be derecognized immediately after the acquisition date along with a subsequent gain recognized that did not depict an economic gain.
Clarification by the board was also made that when applying IFRS 3, that contingent assets should not be recognized in business combinations at the acquisition date, as defined in IAS 37. The Company has assessed that there is no material impact upon adoption of the amendment.

## Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendments to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities, and Contingent Assets)

IAS 37 defines an onerous contract as one in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the entity's obligations exceed the economic benefits to be received under that contract. Unavoidable costs are the lower of the net cost of exiting the contract and the costs to fulfil the contract.
In May 2020, the IASB published an amendment to IFRS 37 that clarifies that the costs of fulfilling a contract should include both the incremental direct costs and an allocation of other costs directly related to fulfilling the contact. The amendment also clarifies that before a separate provision for an onerous contract can be recognized, any impairment loss on assets used in fulfilling the contract must first be recorded.
This expands the potential costs to be recorded and could result in the recognition of more onerous contract provisions. The Company has assessed that there is no material impact upon adoption of the amendment.

## Amendment to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

An amendment was made to clarify which fees should be included in the "10 per cent" test for assessing derecognition of financial liabilities. An entity includes only fees paid or received between the entity (the borrower) and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the entity or the lender on the other's behalf. Costs or fees paid to third parties are not to be included. The Company has assessed that there is no material impact upon adoption of the amendment.

## Accounting standards and amendments issued but not yet adopted in 2022

Certain new standards, interpretations, amendments and improvements to existing standards were issued by the IASB or International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee ("IFRIC") that are not effective for the year ended December 31, 2022, and have not been applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements.
The standards issued that are applicable to the Company are as follows:

## Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17)

IFRS 17 was issued in May 2017 as a replacement for IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts. It requires a current measurement model where estimates are remeasured in each reporting period. The standard allows a choice between recognizing changes in discount rates either in the statement of profit or loss or directly in other comprehensive income. The choice is likely to reflect how insurers account for their financial assets under IFRS 9.

Targeted amendments were made in July 2020 aimed to ease the implementation of the standard by reducing implementation costs and making it easier for entities to explain the results from applying IFRS 17 to investors and others. The amendments also deferred the application date of IFRS 17 to annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is assessing the potential impact of this standard.

# Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12) 

In May 2021 amendments were made to IAS 12 Income Taxes that require companies to recognize deferred tax on transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal amounts of taxable and deductible temporary differences. These will typically apply to transactions such as leases of lessees and decommissioning obligations and will require the recognition of additional deferred tax assets and liabilities. IAS 12 did not previously address how to account for the tax effects of on-balance sheet leases and similar transactions and various approaches were considered acceptable, these amendments attempt to uniform the approach taken.
The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The Company is assessing the potential impact of this standard.

## Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2)

In February 2021 IASB amended IAS 1 to require entities to disclose their material rather than their significant accounting policies. The amendments define what is material accounting policy information and explain how to identify when accounting policy information is material. They further clarify that immaterial accounting policy information does not need to be disclosed. If it is disclosed, it should not obscure material accounting information.
The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The Company is assessing the potential impact of this standard.

## Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8)

The amendment made in February 2021 to IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors clarifies how companies should distinguish changes in accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates. The distinction is important, because changes in accounting estimates are applied prospectively to future transactions and other future events, whereas changes in accounting policies are generally applied retrospectively to past transactions and other past events as well as the current period.
The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The Company is assessing the potential impact of this standard.

## 5 Critical accounting estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates about the future. Estimates are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates. Critical estimates and assumptions were used to determine the value of the following assets and liabilities.

## Intangible assets and goodwill

Intangible assets and goodwill generally arise from business combinations. The Company applies the acquisition method of accounting for these transactions, which involves the allocation of the cost of an acquisition to the underlying net assets acquired based on their respective estimated fair values. As part of this allocation process, the Company must identify and attribute values to the intangible assets acquired. Management applies significant judgement in estimating the fair value of the intangible assets. These determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions regarding projected operating margins, terminal growth rates and discount rates.
These estimates and assumptions determine the amount allocated to intangible assets and goodwill. If future events or results differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions, the Company may record impairment charges in the future.
The Company tests, at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired, in accordance with its accounting policies. The recoverable amounts of CGUs have been estimated based on the greater of fair value less costs to dispose and value in use calculations (Note 19).

## Fair value measurement of financial instruments

When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the discounted cash flow (DCF) model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions relating to these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial on instruments. See Note 31 for further disclosure.

# Inventories

Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost and net realizable value with cost determined on a specific item basis for new and used vehicles. In determining net realizable value for new vehicles, the Company primarily considers the age of the vehicles along with the timing of annual and model changeovers. For used vehicles, the Company considers recent market data and trends such as loss histories along with the current age of the inventory. The determination of net realizable value for inventories involves the use of estimates.

## Redemption liabilities

Redemption liabilities arise during business combinations where non-controlling interest shareholders have the right to require the Company to redeem their equity interests in certain non-wholly owned subsidiaries (refer to Note 14). The redemption amounts are determined with reference to the future profitability generated by those subsidiaries and their operating businesses. The Company will initially recognize a financial liability at the present value of the estimated redemption amount, and at the end of each subsequent reporting period, the Company will revisit its estimates. If the Company revises its estimates, the Company will adjust the carrying amount of the financial liability to reflect revised estimated profitability and the adjustments will be recognized as income or expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

## Leases

i. Critical judgments in determining the lease term

Extension and termination options are included in a number of property leases held by the Company. In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated). Potential future cash outflows have not been included in the lease liability if it is not reasonably certain that the leases will be extended. The assessment is reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs that affects this assessment and that is within the control of the lessee. ii. Estimation uncertainty arising from variable lease payments

Certain leases contain variable payment terms that are linked to the consumer price index.

## Deferred taxes

The extent to which deferred tax assets are recognized is based on estimates of future profitability. Management has concluded that it is probable that the deferred tax assets will be recovered using estimated future taxable income, based on approved business plans and budgets for each segment. The estimates will be updated in future periods, which may result in increases or decreases in the amount of deferred tax assets recognized based on the amount judged to be probable of recovery.

As at December 31, 2022, the Company has recognized the benefit of $\$ 47,501$ (2021 - \$47,787) of the deductible temporary differences, relating to the U.S. Operations, as a deferred tax asset. The Company has concluded that it is probable that the recognized deferred tax assets will be recovered using estimated future taxable income, based on approved business plans and budgets for the segment. This estimate will be updated in future periods, which may result in increases or decreases in the amount of deferred tax assets recognized based on the amount judged to be probable of recovery.
The Company's U.S. Operations have federal and state net operating losses of $\$ 35,162$ and $\$ 52,797$, respectively (2021 - \$45,608 and \$41,610). The federal losses can be carried forward indefinitely, while the state losses expire, between 2038 and 2040.
The Company also has Canadian non-capital losses of $\$ 64,523$ (2021 - \$72,295) available to reduce future taxable income, until their expiry between 2032 and 2042.

1 Intangible assets relate to indefinite-life franchise rights associated with the respective dealerships and certifications related to the respective collision centre. The goodwill is attributable to the workforce, synergies from combining operations of the acquirees and profitability of the acquired businesses. Goodwill of $\$ 5,042$ is deductible for tax purposes.

The results of operations of the acquired entities are included in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity from the date of acquisition. Such results of operations and the related assets and liabilities at the statement of financial position date are included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

The results of operations of the acquired entities since the acquisition dates contributed \$110,039 of revenue and $\$ 4,755$ of net income to the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the period ended December 31, 2022. Had the acquisitions occurred at January 1, 2022, consolidated pro-forma revenue and net income for the period ended December 31, 2022 would have been $\$ 6,188,829$ and $\$ 91,643$ respectively. These pro-forma results are not necessarily representative of future performance.
These amounts have been calculated using the subsidiary's results and adjusting them for:

- Income tax expense (recovery);
- Interest on long-term indebtedness; and
- Leasing arrangements as if they had been entered into on January 1, 2022.

Transaction costs of $\$ 773$ have been expensed and recorded in operating expenses.

# Prior year business acquisitions

- PG Klassic AutoBody acquired in April of 2021; and
- Crystal Lake Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram (CDJR) Inc. ("Crystal Lake") acquired in November of 2021.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, new information was obtained about circumstances that existed at the acquisition date, which resulted in certain adjustments to the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired for the following acquisitions:

- Mark Wilson's Better Used Cars acquired in August of 2021;
- Autolux MB Collision acquired in September of 2021;
- Airdrie Autobody Ltd. ("Airdrie Autobody") acquired in October of 2021; and
- Autopoint Group. ("Autopoint Group") acquired in December of 2021.

These adjustments are immaterial and have been adjusted for prospectively in the December 31, 2022 financial statements. Provisional amounts upon acquisition were previously disclosed in the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 for the above acquisitions.

## Acquisitions in 2021 prior to adjustments of provisional amounts

# 14 Interest in subsidiaries 

Certain subsidiaries of the Company have non-controlling interests ("NCI") held by other parties. The interests in these subsidiaries are summarized as follows:

| Subsidiary | Principal place of business | Proportion of ownership interests held by noncontrolling interests | Proportion of voting rights held by noncontrolling interests | Dividends paid to noncontrolling interests 2022 | Dividends paid to noncontrolling interests 2021 |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |

| RS M Motors LP | Quebec | $5 \%$ | $5 \%$ | - | - |
| Total |  |  |  | 3,247 | 79 |

The subsidiaries are companies that own automotive dealerships and related businesses. For purposes of disclosure, the non-controlling interest profit and loss, and accumulated non-controlling interest of the subsidiaries at the end of the reporting period are reported in aggregate as the subsidiaries are similar in nature and risk, based on assessment of the interest and industry classification.
The Company provides long-term loans to specific NCI parties, and these are presented as other assets (Note 20).

## Transactions with non-controlling interests

On November 30, 2022, the Company acquired a 100\% ownership interest in 156023 Canada Inc. Consideration payable for the shares of $\$ 433$ resulted in an extinguishment of the associated redemption liability. Upon the acquisition of the non-controlling interest above, the Company recognized a decrease in non-controlling interests of $\$ 252$, with a corresponding increase in equity attributable to owners of the parent.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company reorganized capital in certain subsidiaries to bring in new non-controlling parties. The change in ownership did not result in a change of control. Equity attributable to AutoCanada shareholders was increased by $\$ 740$ (2021 - (\$538)) as a result of the reorganization of noncontrolling interests. The transactions resulted in new loans of $\$ 1,845$ (2021 - (\$1,674) being issued to some of these parties to purchase a non-controlling interest in the subsidiaries for $\$ 775$ (2021 - \$2,139). These loans are recorded in Other long-term assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

# Used Digital Retail Division 

A wholly owned subsidiary of the Company is the general partner of AutoCanada UD LP, a limited partnership ("the Partnership") that holds the interest in the used car dealerships acquired as a part of the digital retail strategy (Note 13). The non-controlling unitholders hold put options where they can sell their units back to the Partnership. These put options are recognized as redemption liabilities, measured at fair value at each reporting date, with subsequent changes recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.
The fair value of the put options and associated redemption liabilities has been determined as $\$ 1,050$ (2021 $\$ 659$ ) as at December 31, 2022, as a result of the preferred interest rights in the Partnership and the limited time of operation.

## Redemption liabilities

Canbec Automobile Inc., LMB Automobile Inc., WAM Motors LP, RS M Motors LP, and Auto Bugatti Inc. arrangements contain put options, whereby the non-controlling shareholders are able to sell their shares back to the Company. These put options are recognized as redemption liabilities, measured at their fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The fair value is determined based on the equity value of the related subsidiary (Note 32). Those options eligible to be executed in the next fiscal year are presented as current liabilities.
The continuity of the redemption liabilities is summarized as follows:

|  | December 31, <br> $\mathbf{2 0 2 2}$ <br> $\mathbf{\$}$ | December 31, <br> $\mathbf{2 0 2 1}$ <br> $\mathbf{\$}$ |
| :-- | :--: | :--: |

| Additions in the year (Note 28) | 391 | 224 |
| Derecognition on settlement | $(283)$ | - |
| Adjustment to fair value | 4,829 | 14,116 |
| End of period | $\mathbf{2 7 , 2 6 9}$ | $\mathbf{2 2 , 3 3 2}$ |
| Current redemption liabilities | 26,219 | 21,673 |
| Long-term redemption liabilities | 1,050 | 659 |

15 Cash and cash equivalents

| Short-term deposits | 108,301 | 102,487 |
| Cash and cash equivalents | 108,301 | 102,480 |

Short-term deposits include cash held with a national Canadian financial institution. The Company's revolving floorplan facility agreements allow the Company to hold excess cash in accounts with the financial institution, which is used to offset its finance costs on revolving floorplan facilities. The Company has immediate access to this cash unless it is in default of its facilities, in which case the cash may be used by the financial institution in repayment of its facilities. Refer to Note 31 for further detail regarding cash balances held with the financial institution.

1 Reclassification of comparative figures for presentation purposes (Note 36). The Company previously presented its sales tax receivable as part of other receivables. However, management considers it to be more relevant if all sales tax receivable are presented separately. Prior year comparative as at December 31, 2021 have been revised by reclassifying \$21,157 from other receivables to sales tax receivable. The Company is exposed to normal credit risk with respect to its accounts receivable and maintains provisions for expected credit losses (Note 31). Potential for such losses is mitigated because there is no significant exposure to any single customer and because customer creditworthiness is evaluated before credit is extended.

# Recoveries of impairment

Canadian Operations For the year ended December 31, 2022, two Canadian dealerships (2021 - fifteen) recorded impairment recoveries on indefinite-lived identifiable intangible assets amounting to $\$(8,691)$ (2021 - $\$(39,846)$ ). For the year ended December 31, 2022, \$nil (2021 - \$nil) impairment charges on goodwill were recorded. The recoverable amount for one dealership was determined using the value in use ("VIU") method while the other dealership was determined using the fair value less costs to dispose ("FVLCD") method.

## U.S. Operations

For the year ended December 31, 2022, no U.S. dealerships recorded impairment charges on indefinite-lived identifiable intangible assets and goodwill (2021 - none). The valuation methodology used to assess the recoverable value of the CGUs uses level 2 inputs, indirectly derived from the market, where possible, for key assumptions such as the discount rate. Where level 2 inputs are not available, as is the case with the growth rate, the Company uses level 3 inputs, which are unobservable to the market, but reflect management's best estimates from historical performance and expectations for the future.

## Recoverable amounts

The following table shows the recoverable amounts of CGUs, with impairments or recoveries of impairments recorded in either the current year or prior year, that have not been fully impaired:

1 The CGU was valued using the VIU technique in the prior year. 2 The CGU was valued using the FVLCD technique in the prior year. 3 CGUs under $\$ 10,000$ have been aggregated together, determined to be appropriate given the size of the Company. Comparatives in the table have been updated to aggregate CGU's under \$10,000.

## U.S. Operations

There were no CGUs in the U.S. Operations segment with impairments or recoveries of impairments recorded in either the current year or prior year.

# Impairment test of indefinite life intangible assets 

The assumptions and sensitivities applied in the intangible assets impairment test are described as follows:

## Valuation techniques

The Company did not make any changes to the valuation methodology used to assess impairment in the current year. The recoverable amount of each CGU is based on the greater of fair value less cost to dispose and value in use.

## Value in use

Value in use ("VIU") is predicated upon the value of the future cash flows that a business will generate going forward. The discounted cash flow ("DCF") method is used, which involves projecting cash flows and converting them into a present value equivalent through discounting. The discounting process uses a rate of return that is commensurate with the risk associated with the business or asset and the time value of money. This model requires assumptions about revenue growth rates, operating margins, and discount rates.

## Fair value less costs to dispose

Fair value less costs to dispose ("FVLCD") assumes that companies operating in the same industry will share similar characteristics and that the Company's values will correlate to those characteristics. Therefore, a comparison of a CGU to similar companies may provide a reasonable basis to estimate fair value. Under this model, fair value is calculated based on an applicable multiple applied to projected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Data for EBITDA multiples was based on recent comparable transactions and management estimates. Multiples used in the test for impairment for each CGU were in the range of 2.5 to 8.5 times forecasted EBITDA (2021 - 2.5 to 7.88 times).

## Significant assumptions for VIU

Projected operating margins and growth rates
The assumptions used are based on the Company's internal budget, which is approved by the Board of Directors. The Company projects operating margins and cash flows for a period of one year, and applies growth rates in the cash flow forecast period commensurate with industry forecasts. In arriving at its forecasts, the Company considers past experience, economic trends and inflation as well as industry and market trends.

## Discount rates

The Company applies a discount rate in order to calculate the present value of its projected cash flows. The discount rate represents the Company's internally computed weighted average cost of capital ("WACC") for each CGU with appropriate adjustments for the risks associated with the CGUs in which intangible assets are allocated. The WACC is an estimate of the overall required rate of return on an investment for both debt and equity owners and serves as the basis for developing an appropriate discount rate. Determination of the discount rate requires separate analysis of the cost of equity and debt, and considers a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each CGU. Management applied a discount rate between $11.42 \%$ and $12.72 \%$ in its projections (2021 - $10.62 \%$ and $12.58 \%$ ).

## Significant assumptions for FVLCD

## Projected EBITDA

The Company's assumptions for projected EBITDA are based on the Company's internal budget, which is approved by the Board of Directors. In arriving at the projected EBITDA, the Company considers projected operating margins and growth rates as significant assumptions, past experience, economic trends and inflation as well as industry and market trends.

## EBITDA multiples

EBITDA multiples are based on recent comparable transactions, market comparatives, and management estimates.

# Sensitivity

As there are CGUs that have intangible assets with original costs that exceed their current year carrying amounts, the Company expects future impairments and recoveries of impairments to occur as market conditions change and risk premiums used in developing the discount rate change. The recoverable amount of each CGU is sensitive to changes in market conditions and could result in material changes in the carrying value of intangible assets in the future. Based on sensitivity analysis, no reasonably possible change in key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of any CGU to have a significant change from its current valuation except for the CGUs identified below. CGUs, which use VIU as the basis of recoverable amount, for which a reasonably possible change in key assumptions would cause an impairment, along with the change required for an impairment to occur are as follows:

|  Cash Generating Unit | Change in discount rate | Change in growth rate | Carrying amount \$ | Recoverable amount exceeds carrying amount \$  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  December 31, 2022 |  |  |  |   |
|  AK | $0.02 \%$ | $0.10 \%$ | 22,117 | -  |

|  December 31, 2021 |  |  |  |   |
|  K | $0.21 \%$ | $0.97 \%$ | 14,575 | -  |

CGUs, which use FVLCD as the basis of recoverable amount, for which a reasonably possible change in key assumptions would cause an impairment, along with the change required for an impairment to occur are as follows:

|  Cash Generating Unit | Change in multiple | Recoverable amount \$ | Carrying amount \$ | Recoverable amount exceeds carrying amount \$  |

1 Reclassification of comparative figures for presentation purposes (Note 36). The Company previously presented its provision for employee costs as part of legal and others. However, management considers it to be more relevant if all employee costs provisions are presented separately. Prior year comparative as at January 1, 2021 have been revised by reclassifying \$4,169 from Legal and other to Employee costs.

## Employee costs

The balance represents management's best estimate of the most likely outcome of the Company's liability associated with termination benefits and employment claims.

## Legal and other

The balance represents the non-recurring legal and loss provision associated with certain wholesale transactions for the period ended December 31, 2018, management's best estimate of the most likely outcome of the Company's liability under ongoing legal claims.

Terms and conditions of outstanding loans are as follows:
i. On February 7, 2022, the Company issued Senior Unsecured Notes (the "New Issuance Notes") of \$350 million aggregate principal amount at par for a stated interest rate of $5.75 \%$ to fund a redemption of the then outstanding $\$ 250$ million Senior Unsecured Notes ("the Notes"). The Company redeemed the full $\$ 250$ million outstanding balance on February 10, 2022. A charge of $\$ 9.9$ million was recognized in profit or loss in relation to the extinguishment of the Notes (Note 11). The New Issuance Notes have a term of seven years and mature on February 7, 2029. Interest is payable semi-annually on February 7 and August 7 of each year the New Issuance Notes are outstanding. Concurrent with the redemption of the Notes, the associated embedded derivative was extinguished, and a loss on extinguishment of $\$ 29.3$ million was recorded in Finance costs (Note 11).
The New Issuance Notes agreement contains certain redemption options whereby the Company can redeem all or part of the New Issuance Notes at prices set forth in the agreement, following certain dates specified in the agreement. In addition, at any time prior to February 7, 2025, the Company may at its option redeem up to $40 \%$ of the aggregate principal amount of the New Issuance Notes with net cash proceeds from equity offerings at a specified redemption price in the agreement. The New Issuance Note holders also have the right to require the Company to redeem the New Issuance Notes or a portion thereof, at the redemption prices set forth in the agreement in the event of a change in control. These redemption features constitute embedded derivatives that are required to be separated from the New Issuance Notes and measured at fair value.

The embedded derivative components of these compound financial instruments are measured at fair value at each reporting date with gains or losses in fair value recognized through profit or loss (Note 11). For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized an embedded derivative of \$nil related to these redemption options.
ii. On February 7, 2022, the Company amended the $\$ 1,300$ million syndicated credit agreement ("Credit Facility") with the Bank of Nova Scotia ("Scotiabank"), the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ("CIBC"), the Royal Bank of Canada ("RBC"), HSBC Bank Canada ("HSBC"), ATB Financial ("ATB"), the Bank of Montreal ("BMO"), and The Toronto-Dominion Bank ("TD"), while maintaining its existing specified-use tranches and facility limits. The amendment included changes to the interest rate structure, covenants, and other administrative and structural changes to add flexibility to meet the Company's operational needs on an ongoing basis. Concurrently, the amendment was also executed to support both the issuance of the $\$ 350$ million senior unsecured notes issued on February 7, 2022 and the repayment of the previous $\$ 250$ million senior unsecured notes. The Credit Facility term was also extended to April 14, 2025.
On December 12, 2022, the Company amended the Credit Facility with Scotiabank, CIBC, RBC, HSBC, ATB, BMO, and TD. The amendment included administrative and other structural changes made to support planned future growth. There were no material changes to the Credit Facility's specified-use tranches, interest rates or covenants for disclosure purposes. The Credit Facility term remains until April 14, 2025.
In addition, on December 12, 2022, the Company executed the accordion feature to increase the revolving credit limit by $\$ 50$ million, from $\$ 225$ million.

In the case of advances under the revolving facility, the margins above the prime rate, banker's acceptance rate, US base rate or LIBOR rate are subject to a pricing grid based on the then applicable ratio of senior net funded debt to EBITDA. As at December 31, 2022, the Company would have been in the first of five tiers of the pricing grid which provides for advances at the prime rate or US base rate plus $0.75 \%$ (2021 - 1.25\%) for total of $7.20 \%$ (2021 - 3.70\%) at December 31, 2022 or at the banker's acceptance rate or LIBOR rate plus $1.75 \%$ (2021 - 2.25\%) for total of $6.22 \%$ (2021 - 2.69\%) at December 31, 2022. The wholesale leasing facilities bear interest rates of Canadian Dollar Offered Rate ("CDOR") plus 1.75\% (2021 $2.25 \%$ ) for a total of $6.22 \%$ (2021 - $2.69 \%$ ) as at December 31, 2022. The wholesale floorplan facilities bear interest rates of CDOR plus 1.00\% (2021 - 1.05\%) for a total of 5.47\% (2021 - 1.49\%) as at December 31, 2022 except for facility for floorplan of used export vehicles which bears interest rates of CDOR plus 1.25\% (2021 - 1.30\%) for total of 5.72\% (2021 - 1.74\%) as at December 31, 2022.

The agreement has certain reporting requirements and financial covenants. The floorplan facility is collateralized by each individual dealership's inventories that are directly financed by the facility. The revolving credit facility is collateralized by certain of the Company's real property and fixed assets, as well as certain current receivable and inventory assets not otherwise pledged as collateral.

iii. VW Credit Canada, Inc. ("VCCI") provides floorplan financing for new and used vehicles for all of the Company's Volkswagen, Audi, and Porsche dealerships (the "VCCI facilities"). During the second quarter of 2022, amendments were made to include two additional dealerships to the floorplan financing (Audi Windsor and Porsche Center London). This resulted in an amendment to the maximum amount of financing provided by the VCCI facilities to $\$ 122,995$. As at December 31, 2022, the maximum amount of financing was $\$ 122,995$ (2021 - \$98,545). The VCCI facilities bear interest of RBC prime rate plus 0.00\%$0.25 \%$ (2021 - $0.00 \%-0.25 \%$ ). The RBC prime rate was $6.45 \%$ at December 31, 2022 (2021 - 2.45\%). The combined total interest rates were $6.45 \%-6.70 \%$ (2021 - $2.45 \%-2.70 \%$ ). The VCCI facilities have certain reporting requirements and financial covenants and are collateralized by all of the dealerships' assets financed by VCCI. The individual notes payable of the VCCI facilities are due when the related vehicle is sold.
iv. BMW Financial Services Canada ("BMW Financial"), a division of BMW Canada Inc., provides floorplan financing for new, used and demonstrator vehicles for all of the Company's BMW dealerships (the "BMW Facilities"). During the second quarter of 2022, amendments were made to the maximum advance limit to $\$ 118,050$. As at December 31, 2022, the maximum advance limit was $\$ 118,050$ (2021 - \$109,550). The BMW Facilities bears interest rate of prime minus $0.40 \%$ (2021 - $0.40 \%$ ) per 360 day annum for a total of $6.05 \%$ at December 31, 2022 (2021 - 2.05\%). The BMW Facilities have certain reporting requirements and financial covenants and are collateralized by the dealerships' movable and immovable property.
v. RBC provides floorplan financing for new, used and demonstrator vehicles for three of the Company's dealerships (the "RBC Facilities"). During the first, second, and third quarters of 2022, amendments were made to the maximum advance limit to $\$ 56,000, \$ 50,000$, and $\$ 55,000$ respectively.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had total cash outflows for leases of \$27,214 (2021 $\$ 25,922)$.

## Rent concessions

The Company negotiated certain rent concessions on property leases primarily related to the deferral of rent payments for a three-month period, predominantly during the second quarter of 2020 in exchange for future repayment of the concessions or extensions to the respective lease terms. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not receive any additional rent concessions and \$nil (2021 - \$109) remains of the overall negotiated cash deferral of $\$ 4,169$, which was repaid over various terms ending in 2022. The optional exemption for all eligible rent concessions has been applied for leases with similar characteristics and the financial impact was nominal to the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Certain leases did not meet the criteria for the optional exemption due to substantive lease term extensions.

# Other disclosures 

Other than depreciation, the following amounts have been recognized in income:

|  | 2022 | 2021 |
| :-- | --: | --: |

As at December 31, 2022, potential cash outflows of $\$ 635,856$ (2021 - \$596,394), (undiscounted), have not been included in the lease liability as it is not reasonably certain the extension options will be exercised. The financial effect of including reasonably certain extension options in leases liabilities and right-of-use assets is 111,146 (2021 - \$98,225).

## Leases as lessor

# 24 Derivative financial instruments

Derivative financial instruments are held for the purpose of managing exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.

## Foreign exchange risk

The Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to economically hedge foreign currency risk. These contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in fair value are immediately recognized in net income.

Interest rate risk The Company enters into interest rate swaps to hedge the variable rates of a portion of the syndicated floorplan facility and the revolving term facility, transforming the variable rate exposure to fixed rate obligations. Certain interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and periodically assessed for effectiveness. Where the hedging relationship is assessed as being effective, changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income. Changes in fair value on derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are immediately recognized in net income. These instruments have settlement periods through to June 2025. Changes in the fair value of these instruments will be recorded in Finance costs as the Company has not elected to apply hedge accounting to these contracts. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there were no changes to the designation of cash flow hedges. The fair values and notional amounts of derivative financial instruments are as follows:

|   | Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts | Interest Rate Swaps |  |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   |  | Non-hedges | Cash flow hedges | Non-hedges  |

### Hedge ineffectiveness

Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument.

The Company enters into interest rate swaps that have similar critical terms as the hedged item, such as interest rate, payment dates, maturities and notional amount. The Company does not hedge 100% of its loans, therefore, the hedged item is identified as a proportion of the outstanding loans up to the notional amount of the swaps. As all critical terms matched during the year, the economic relationship was 100% effective.

### Effect of IBOR reform

Following the financial crisis, the reform and replacement of benchmark interest rates such as CDOR and other interbank offered rates ("IBORs") has become a priority for global regulators (referred to as "IBOR reform"). The Canadian Alternative Reference Rate Working Group (CARR) was created to identify and seek to develop a new risk-free Canadian dollar interest rate benchmark. Although there are no plans to immediately discontinue CDOR rates, an enhanced Canadian Oversight Repo Rate Average (CORRA) has been designed to comply with recommendations of the Financial Stability Board as part of a global effort to reform benchmark interest rates. As a result, while CORRA has been officially announced, it has not been approved and there is uncertainty about how the Canadian dollar benchmark rates will evolve and the speed at which CORRA will become a dominant benchmark for Canadian dollar borrowings. All of the Company's hedging instruments are currently based on CDOR.

The Company performs a qualitative assessment of hedge ineffectiveness for interest rate swaps, which may occur due to:

- the credit value/debit value adjustment on the interest rate swaps which is not matched by the loan;
- differences in critical terms between the interest rate swaps and loans; and
- the effects of the forthcoming reforms to CDOR because these may take effect at a different time and have a different impact on the hedged item (the floating-rate debt) and the hedging instrument (the interest rate swap used to hedge the debt).

The associated derivative financial instruments were valued at $\$ 1,939$ as at December 31, 2022 (2021 - \$8,299). There was no ineffectiveness for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
The Company has evaluated the extent to which its cash flow hedging relationships are subject to uncertainty driven by IBOR reform as at December 31, 2022. As the CDOR rate associated with the derivative financial instrument was still in effect, there was no impact from the IBOR reform.

# 25 Vehicle repurchase obligations 

The Company operates service loaner programs and provides vehicles to a third party vehicle rental company with individual terms not to exceed 12 months, at which time the Company has an obligation to repurchase each vehicle at a predetermined amount. As a result, the Company has recorded the contractual repurchase amounts as outstanding vehicle repurchase obligations and has classified the liability as current due to the short-term nature of the obligation.

## 26 Other liabilities

## Other long-term liabilities

## Equity forward liability

The Company has entered into an equity forward purchase agreement with a major Canadian financial institution to reduce its cash and income exposure to fluctuations in its share price relating to the Restricted Share Units ("RSUs"), Deferred Share Units ("DSUs"), and Share Appreciation Rights ("SARs"). Pursuant to the agreement, the Company receives the economic benefit of share price appreciation and suffers the economic loss of share price depreciation, while providing payments to the financial institution for the institution's cost of funds minus dividends. As the agreement requires settlement in shares, the liability has been recorded as the present value of the settlement and is not subject to remeasurement.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company entered into equity forward agreements for a total of 100,000 (2021 - 150,000) outstanding common shares. The equity forward agreements settle on December 27, 2024 and August 28, 2025 for 150,000 and 100,000 common shares, respectively. The Company and the counterparty have the option to settle 100,000 common shares under the equity forward agreement in advance of the contractual settlement date.

The following table shows the change in the equity forward liability for the years ended:

|   | December 31, 2022 |  | December 31, 2021 |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   | Number of shares | \$ | Number of shares | \$  |

|  Outstanding, end of the period | 250,000 | 9,091 | 150,000 | 6,201  |

# Restructuring charges

Restructuring charges are related to the voluntary termination of two franchises in year ended December 31, 2019 and the operating costs of the related leased facility, with $\$ 1,242$ (2021 - \$1,736) being utilized and recognized in Operating expenses (Note 8) during the year ended December 31, 2022.

## 27 Commitments and contingencies

## Lawsuits and legal claims

The Company is engaged in various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The outcome of all of the proceedings and claims against the Company is subject to future resolution, including the uncertainties of litigation. Based on information currently known to the Company and after consultation with outside legal counsel, management believes that the probable ultimate resolution of any such proceedings and claims, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company, taken as a whole. Note 21 includes provisions to account for information known to the Company and based on estimates of probable resolutions. The Company's operations are subject to federal, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations in Canada. While the Company has not identified any costs likely to be incurred in the next several years, based on known information for environmental matters, the Company's ongoing efforts to identify potential environmental concerns in connection with the properties it leases may result in the identification of environmental costs and liabilities. The magnitude of such additional liabilities and the costs of complying with environmental laws or remediating contamination cannot be reasonably estimated at the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position date due to lack of technical information, absence of third party claims, the potential for new or revised laws and regulations and the ability to recover costs from any third parties. Thus, the likelihood of any such costs or whether such costs would be material cannot be determined at this time.

## Letters of guarantee

The Company has outstanding letters of guarantee totaling $\$ 4,771$ as at December 31, 2022 (2021 - \$4,402) with various due dates. The Company will settle obligations as they arise for which these letters have been issued as security and it is not the Company's intent that draws will be made on these letters.

## Capital commitments

As at December 31, 2022, the Company is committed to capital expenditure obligations in the amount of $\$ 12,134$ (2021 - \$2,971) related to dealership relocations, dealership re-imagings, and dealership Open Points with expected completion of these commitments in 2023.

# 28 Share-based payments

The Company operates an equity-settled compensation plan under which it receives services from employees as consideration for share-based payments. The plans are as follows:

## Restricted Share Units (RSUs)

The Company grants RSUs to designated management employees. Effective in 2018, the RSU Plan was modified such that awards are intended to be settled in shares. The RSUs are also entitled to earn additional units based on dividend payments made by the Company and the share price on date of payment. The RSUs granted are scheduled to vest at different intervals over three years - conditional upon continued employment with the Company. The number of RSUs granted is determined based on the grant value divided by the weighted average share price of the Company's simple average share price for the seven days prior to the vesting date. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 23,767 (2021 - 33,549) RSUs were granted at a fair value of $\$ 30.34$ (2021 - \$30.88). The fair value of the RSUs granted is recognized as an expense over the period in which the RSUs are expected to vest. The RSU Plan settles by way of common shares, based on the Company's volume weighted average share price for the seven days prior to the vesting date. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 178,598 (2021 - 37,626) RSUs were settled, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was $\$ 28.51$ (2021 - \$33.96). For the year ended December 31, 2022, 1,391 (2021 - 3,692) RSUs were forfeited, the fair value of the RSUs forfeited in the year was $\$ 20.70$ (2021 - \$10.48). The following table shows the change in the number of RSUs for the years ended:

|   | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2021  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   | Number of
RSUs | Number of
RSUs  |
|  Outstanding, beginning of the year | 308,687 | 316,456  |

|  Forfeited units | $(1,391)$ | $(3,692)$  |
|  Outstanding, end of the year | 152,465 | 308,687  |

During the year ended December 31, 2022, 121,267 RSUs were vested but not settled.

## Deferred Share Units (DSUs)

Independent members of the Board of Directors are paid a portion of their annual retainer in the form of DSUs. They may also elect to receive up to $100 \%$ of their remaining cash remuneration in the form of DSUs. Effective in 2018, the DSU Plan was modified such that awards are intended to be settled in shares. The underlying security of DSUs are the Company's common shares and are valued based on the Company's average share price for the five business days prior to the date on which Directors' fees are granted. The DSUs are also entitled to earn additional units based on dividend payments made by the Company and the share price on date of payment. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 38,200 (2021 - 15,629) DSUs were granted at a fair value of $\$ 28.33$ (2021 - \$40.83). The fair value is recognized as an expense over the period in which the DSUs are granted. The DSUs granted are scheduled to vest upon the termination date of the Director, at which time, the DSUs will be settled in common shares no earlier than the termination date and no later than December 15 of the calendar year following the Director's termination date. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 55,422 (2021 - nil) DSUs were settled, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was $\$ 30.44$ (2021 - \$nil). The weighted average share price value is based on the volume weighted average price of the Company's share price for the five business days prior to the date of settlement.

The following table shows the change in the number of DSUs for the years ended:

|   | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2021  |

|  Outstanding, end of the year | 141,048 | 158,270  |

# Stock Option Plan

The Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") is designed to provide long-term incentives to designated management to deliver long-term shareholder returns. Under the Plan, participants are granted options which only vest if certain service and market conditions are met. The terms of the Plan specify that following retirement an employee may exercise vested options with the rights to exercise continuing for 120 days following the retirement date. Options are granted under the Plan for no consideration and carry no dividend or voting rights. When exercisable, each option is exercisable to acquire one common share. The exercise price of options is determined by the Board and shall not be lower than the closing price of the AutoCanada shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange immediately preceding the date of grant. The following table shows the change in the number of stock options for the years ended:

|   | December 31, 2022 |  | December 31, 2021 |   |

The weighted average remaining contractual life for the share options outstanding as at December 31, 2021 was 6.27 years.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the assessed weighted average fair value at grant date of options granted was $\$ 12.66$ per option. The fair value at grant date is determined using the Black-Scholes Model that takes into account the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the share price at grant date, the expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield of the underlying share and the risk-free interest rate for the term of the option.

The weighted average model inputs for options granted during the year ended December 31, 2022 include:

- Options are granted for no consideration and vest based on varying service and market price conditions over a four year period. Vested options are exercisable until December 22, 2028.
- Exercise price: $22.63
- Grant date: December 22, 2022
- Life of option: 6 years
- Share price at grant date: $22.59
- Expected price volatility of the Company's shares: 57.10%
- Expected dividend yield: 0.00%
- Risk-free interest rate: 3.15%

Expected price volatility was determined at the time of grant using the AutoCanada share price on a historical basis. It reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, there were expenses of $1,800 (2021 - $479) and $276 recoveries (2021 - $nil).

### Share Appreciation Rights (SARs)

The share appreciation rights are designed to enable those granted rights under the plan to participate in the growth and profitability of the Company. Rights granted vest upon certain service and market conditions over a maximum period of four years. Vested rights are exercisable for a maximum period of six years after grant date.

Each share appreciation right that is exercised entitles the employee to receive a number of common shares that is equal to (i) the amount by which the fair market value of one common share exceeds the notional exercise price of the vested share appreciation right; divided by (ii) the fair market value of one common share.

The following table shows the change in the number of SARs for the year ended:

|   | December 31, 2022 |  | December 31, 2021 |   |

|  Vested and exercisable, end of the year | 18.66 | 94,333 | 12.17 | 66,000  |

No share appreciation rights expired for year ended December 31, 2022.

The weighted average contractual life remaining for these share appreciation rights as at December 31, 2022 is 4.79 years (2021 - 2.81 years).

The assessed weighted average fair value at grant date of the share appreciation rights granted during the year ended December 31, 2022 was $14.75 per option. The fair value at grant date has been determined using the Black-Scholes Model. For certain SARs with market vesting conditions, the fair value at grant date has been determined using an adjusted form of the Black-Scholes Model that takes into account probabilities using the Monte Carlo simulation.

The weighted average model inputs for the share appreciation rights granted during the year ended December 31, 2022 include:

- Rights are granted for no consideration and vest based on varying service and market price conditions over a four year period. Vested rights are exercisable until August 22, 2028.
- Exercise price: $\$ 31.00$
- Expected life of option: 4.66 years
- Share price at grant date: $\$ 28.00$
- Expected price volatility of the Company's shares: $56.21 \%$
- Expected dividend yield: $0.00 \%$
- Risk-free interest rate: $3.18 \%$

Expected price volatility was determined at the time of grant using the AutoCanada share price on a historical basis, adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information. It reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.

# Used Digital Retail Division 

Common interests of the Partnership are granted to dealership management and the Executive Chairman (Note 33) under an equity issuance plan (the "Digital Plan"). This is designed to provide long-term incentives to dealership and related party management to develop and deliver long-term returns on the digital retail initiative (Note 14).
Equity interests are issued under the Digital Plan for the fair value of the interests at grant date and carry no dividend or voting rights. The interests vest in accordance with the terms stated in the initial grant agreements. When exercisable, the consideration paid to the equity interest holders is based on the value of the Partnership on the date of exercise and will be settled in common shares.
The Executive Chair holds a 15\% interest, that contains a share-based payment arrangement that vested immediately upon grant, in the Partnership. Share-based compensation expense of $\$ 391$ (2021 - \$224) was recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

## Share-Based Compensation Expense

Total expenses net of recoveries arising from share-based payment transactions recognized during the year included in employee costs are as follows:

# Treasury shares

Shares are held in trust to mitigate the risk of future share price increases from the time the equity-settled awards (Note 28) are granted to when they are fully vested and can be exercised. Under the Trust Agreement, the third party trustee will administer the distribution of shares to the beneficiaries upon vesting, as directed by the Company. Dividends earned on the shares held in trust are reinvested to purchase additional shares. No dividends were earned during the year ended December 31, 2022 (2021 - \$nil). The shares held in trust are accounted for as treasury shares and are recognized on a first-in-first-out basis upon issuance and presented separately in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity. The following table shows the change in treasury shares held for the years ended:

## Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share was calculated by dividing earnings attributable to AutoCanada shareholders by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Basic earnings per share are adjusted by the dilutive impact of all share-based payment plans to calculate the diluted earnings per share.

# 30 Capital disclosures

The Company's objective when managing its capital is to safeguard the Company's assets and its ability to continue as a going concern while at the same time maximizing the growth of the business, returns to shareholders, and benefits for other stakeholders. The Company views its capital as the combination of longterm indebtedness and equity. The calculation of the Company's capital is summarized below:

|   | December 31,
2022 | December 31,
2021  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Long-term indebtedness (Note 22) | 554,351 | 285,908  |
|  Equity | 486,797 | 519,409  |
|   | $1,041,148$ | 805,317  |

The Company manages its capital structure in accordance with changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust its capital structure, the Company may assume additional debt, refinance existing debt with different characteristics, sell assets to reduce debt, issue new shares or adjust the amount of dividends paid to its shareholders. The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as at December 31, 2022.

## Net indebtedness

Net indebtedness is a measure used by management to evaluate the liquidity of the Company. Net indebtedness is calculated as total indebtedness (as shown in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position), adjusted to remove any associated embedded derivative impacts, less cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

|   | December 31,
2022 | December 31,
2021  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Total indebtedness | 555,128 | 285,908  |

|  Total indebtedness (Note 22) | 555,128 | 315,214  |
|  Cash and cash equivalents | 108,301 | 102,480  |
|  Net Indebtedness | 446,827 | 212,734  |

## 31 Financial instruments

Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognized, in respect of each class of financial asset and financial liability, are disclosed in the significant accounting policies (Note 3). The Company's financial assets are measured at amortized cost. The Company's financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost except for redemption liabilities and non-hedged interest swaps, which are carried at fair value through profit or loss. The carrying values of financial instruments approximate their fair values, excluding the senior unsecured notes. The fair value of the senior unsecured notes is $\$ 306,250$.

## Financial risk management objectives

The Company's activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks of varying degrees of significance, which could affect the Company's ability to achieve its strategic objectives. AutoCanada's overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial and economic markets and seeks to reduce potential adverse effects on the Company's financial performance. Risk management is carried out by financial management in conjunction with overall corporate governance. The principal financial risks to which the Company is exposed are described below.

## Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign currency and interest rates.

# Foreign currency risk 

The Company has operations in Canada and the United States. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions and recognized assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency of the relevant entity. The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk because its Canadian and U.S. operations engage in transactions denominated in a currency other than their respective functional currency. Risk arises as a result of specific transfers associated with working capital between Canadian and U.S. operations as well as wholesale used vehicle transactions where Canadian operations will participate in disciplined cross-border sales when arbitrage opportunities are present.

## Interest rate risk

The Company's exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section herein, the indebtedness note (Note 22), and the derivative financial instruments note (Note 24). The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates at the reporting date and stipulated change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period. The amounts below represent the absolute change to the reported account, an increase in the basis point would result in a positive amount and a decrease in the basis point would result in a negative amount. A 100 basis point change and 200 basis point change is used when reporting interest risk internally to key management personnel and represents management's assessment of the possible change in interest rates.

|  | +/- 200 Basis Point |  |  | +/- 100 Basis Point |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  | 2022 | 2021 |  | 2022 | 2021 |
|  | \$ | \$ |  | \$ | \$ |
| Finance costs | 18,217 | 7,971 |  | 9,108 | 3,986 |
| Finance income | 82 | 16 |  | 41 | 8 |

## Embedded derivative

The early redemption embedded derivative asset on the New Issuance Notes (Note 22) is subject to interest rate risk in the form of impacting the fair market valuation of the embedded derivative recorded. There is no change in fair value based on $+/-200$ basis or $+/-100$ basis point change.

## Credit risk

The Company's exposure to credit risk associated with its accounts receivable is the risk that a customer will be unable to pay amounts due to the Company. Concentration of credit risk with respect to contracts-in-transit and accounts receivable is limited primarily to automobile manufacturers and financial institutions. Credit risk arising from receivables with commercial customers is not significant due to the large number of customers dispersed across various geographic locations comprising the Company's customer base. Details of the aging of the Company's trade and other receivables are disclosed in the table below.
The Company applies the simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses, which uses a lifetime expected credit loss allowance for all trade receivables. The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over the 12 -month periods prior to December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within these periods.
The loss allowance for trade receivables as at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was determined as follows:

|  | December 31, 2022 |  |  | December 31, 2021 |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  | Expected loss rate $\%$ | Gross carrying amount - Trade receivables $\$$ | Expected loss allowance (Note 16) $\$$ | Expected loss rate $\%$ | Gross carrying amount - Trade receivables $\$$ |
| Current | 0.02 | 153,091 | 31 | 0.05 | 97,407 |
| 31 - 60 days | 1.06 | 17,017 | 180 | 2.13 | 12,471 |
| 61 - 90 days | 2.65 | 13,315 | 353 | 4.82 | 8,215 |
| 91 - 120 days | 2.82 | 7,755 | 219 | 9.91 | 2,062 |
| $>120$ days | 3.26 | 28,318 | 923 | 10.25 | 15,236 |
| Total |  | 219,496 | 1,706 |  | 135,391 |

|   | $ | $  |
|  Balance, January 1 | 2,478 | 1,990  |
|  Loan loss allowance recognized in profit or loss during the year | 1,273 | 2,984  |
|  Receivables written off during the year | (2,045) | (2,496)  |
|  Balance, December 31 | 1,706 | 2,478  |

The amounts disclosed on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position for accounts receivable are net of the expected loss allowance, details of which are disclosed in Note 16. When a trade and other receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for trade and other receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

Concentration of cash and cash equivalents exist due to the significant amount of cash held with a Canadian financial institution (refer to Note 15 for further discussion of the Company's concentration of cash held on deposit with the financial institution). The syndicated revolving floorplan facility (Note 22) allows the Company's dealerships to hold excess cash (used to satisfy working capital requirements of the Company's various Original Equipment Manufacturer ("OEM") partners) in an account with the financial institution which bears interest at 5.470% at December 31, 2022 (2021 - 1.488%). These cash balances are fully accessible by the Company's dealerships at any time; however, in the event of a default by a dealership in its floorplan obligation; the cash may be used to offset unpaid balances under the facility. As a result, there is a concentration of cash balances risk to the Company in the event of a default under the facility.

### Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company is not able to meet its financial obligations as they become due or can do so only at excessive cost. The Company's activity is financed through a combination of the cash flows from operations, borrowing under existing credit facilities and the issuance of equity. Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents and the availability of funding through adequate amounts of committed credit facilities. One of management's primary goals is to maintain an optimal level of liquidity through the active management of the assets and liabilities as well as cash flows.

As at December 31, 2022, the Company has $95,000 (2021 - $160,000) in readily available liquidity from its revolving term facility. However, the Company's ability to borrow under this facility requires it to comply with its financial covenants.

The following tables detail the Company's remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities. The amounts below have been determined based on the undiscounted contractual maturities of the financial liabilities.

# 32 Fair value of financial instruments

The Company's financial instruments as at December 31, 2022 are represented by cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, other liabilities, revolving and non-revolving floorplan facilities, vehicle repurchase obligations, indebtedness, an embedded derivative, redemption liabilities, and derivative financial instruments. The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, other liabilities and revolving floorplan facilities approximate their carrying values due to their short-term nature. The indebtedness has a carrying value that approximates the fair value due to the floating rate nature of the debt. While there is a portion that has a fixed rate, the indebtedness has a carrying value that is not materially different from its fair value. The embedded derivative (Level 2) included within indebtedness (Note 22) is carried at fair value using the Hull White pricing model. Derivative financial instruments are made up of interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts (Level 2). The fair value of both instruments are calculated as the present value of the future cash flows. Both contractually agreed payments and forward rates are used to calculate the cash flows, which are then discounted on the basis of a yield curve that is observable in the market. Redemption liabilities (Level 3) are remeasured at fair value each reporting period with the gain or loss being recognized through profit or loss (Note 14). The fair value was determined based on the prevailing and comparable market interest rates. The fair value hierarchy categorizes fair value measurements into three levels based on the inputs to valuation technique, which are defined as follows:

- Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).
- Level 3 - Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs). There were no transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy during the year.

# 33 Related party transactions

## Transactions with companies controlled by Directors
