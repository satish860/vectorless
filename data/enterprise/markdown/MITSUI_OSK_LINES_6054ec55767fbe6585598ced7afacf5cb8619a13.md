# Supporting and Changing the World from the Blue Oceans

Since our founding more than 100 years ago, we have taken on new business challenges by making use of the oceans and establishing bonds with countries, companies, and people around the world.

Now, we are beginning ambitious new initiatives.

MOL will realize transport that is safe, economical, and environment-friendly, introduce trailblazing marine transport technologies, and take on the challenge of expanding new business with the growth regions.

Our overriding goal is to transform from a full-line marine transport company into a social infrastructure group centered on marine transport. We will continue taking on the challenge of further evolution aimed at achieving a sustainable future.

- **MOL Group Corporate Mission**

From the blue oceans, we sustain people's lives and ensure a prosperous future.

- **MOL Group Vision**

We will develop a variety of social infrastructure businesses in addition to traditional shipping businesses, and will meet the evolving social needs including environmental conservation, with innovative technology and services.

MOL group aims to be a strong and resilient corporate group that provides new skills for all stakeholders and grows globally.

## **Open Publication of MOL REPORT 2022**

Having experienced the booming emerging economies of the 2000s and two structural reforms of its businesses in the 2010s, the MOL Group is presently in the process of dramatically changing its corporate profile. This transformation is being advanced and led by the CEO, who took office in April 2021. In the same month, the MOL Group revised its corporate mission, long-term vision, values, and action guidelines to reflect society's current expectations.

We have published MOL Report 2022 to provide an easy-to-understand explanation of our goal—which is to become a social infrastructure group centered on marine transport—and the type of value that we will create by realizing this goal. Accordingly, we have included explanations that are more detailed and specific based on Rolling Plan 2022 and the MOL Sustainability Plan, which were announced in April 2022.

We have also provided an overview of initiatives to enhance the effectiveness of governance in recent years and the benefits of these initiatives.

We sincerely hope this report serves as a tool that deepens dialogue with shareholders, investors, and other stakeholders, thereby enabling management to resolve better feedback and further enhancing disclosure.

# With "a social infrastructure group centered on marine transport" as its slogan, the MDL Group will realize its comprehensive strength to advance bold initiatives for global growth.

## **Aiming Achieved Record Profits, Entering a New Growth Phase**

Fiscal 2021, ended March 31, 2022, provided many opportunities to think about our social mission. Due to logistics disruption, sending and receiving essential goods in a timely manner remained challenging in various locations worldwide. Although this was not an issue we could resolve on our own, we regretted being unable to fully meet our core role as a shipping company. The overriding purpose of a company is to continue providing society with value through business activities. A revision of our corporate mission in fiscal 2021 rededicated us to the fulfillment of our social mission. Given the strain being felt around the world due to shortages of goods and soaring prices, we must continue providing services in ways that facilitate day-to-day life and economic activities.

As for our business performance, meanwhile, we were able to achieve record profits, posting ordinary profit of ¥721.7 billion. As a result, fiscal 2021 proved to be a very fruitful year in which our financial position improved markedly. Analysis of our business performance tends to focus on the historically high freight rates enjoyed by the containership business. However, our performance is also attributable to the steadily emerging benefits of structural reforms implemented to date. For example, the April 2021 establishment of MDL Drybulk Ltd. has enabled the Headquarters of Dry Bulk Business to provide one-stop services and improve profitability. Similarly, adjustment of tonnage volume and rationalization of vessel allocation have greatly enhanced the profitability of the car carrier business. Admittedly, a large contribution is being made by equity in earnings of affiliates from Ocean Network Express Pte. Ltd. (ONE), which is responsible for the containership business. Nonetheless, I am extremely happy to report that, even if the contribution from ONE is excluded, we are ahead of schedule in reaching the medium-term profit targets set in fiscal 2017, when we introduced rolling management plans.

In addition, we steadily progressed in realizing the Environmental Strategy set out as a priority in Rolling Plan 2021. Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is certain to require new capital investment and the use of expensive fuels. The extra costs inevitably associated with such environmental initiatives previously led some Group personnel to adopt a stance of fulfilling the minimum requirements when there was no choice but preferring to avoid these initiatives whenever possible. However, since announcing MDL Group Environmental Vision 2.1 in June 2021 and clearly explaining to internal and external stakeholders the direction in which we must proceed, I feel that the mindset of Group officers and employees has transformed. Understanding of the need to earnestly tackle climate change countermeasures has progressed greatly. Based on the recognition that if climate change continues at the current rate the whole world will be in deep trouble, there is a growing awareness within the Company of thinking together with customers about the best solutions and encouraging initiatives that make both our businesses and those of customers sustainable.

## **Aiming to Stably Generate Profits on a Scale Commensurate with Accumulated Shareholders' Equity**

The MDL Group's shareholders' equity has grown dramatically thanks to favorable performances over the past two fiscal years. If the Group performs as expected in fiscal 2022, shareholders' equity will reach approximately ¥2.0 trillion in the near future. I believe that, having been entrusted with the capital of shareholders, we have a responsibility to pursue as a minimum target a return of about 10.0% of shareholders' equity, or in other words, profits of roughly ¥200.0 billion.

To stably realize profits of ¥200.0 billion, we will require ONE to continue making solid contributions even after container freight rates have normalized. Assuming that ONE's sales range is between ¥2.0 trillion and ¥3.0 trillion, we would like to get the company on track to achieve a profit margin of between 5.0% and 10.0%. If this is realized, ONE's profits are likely to trend between about ¥100.0 billion and ¥300.0 billion, which means that MDL can expect to record equity in earnings.

## A Message from the CEO

of affiliates of between roughly ¥30.0 billion and ¥100.0 billion. In addition, we will steadily solidify marine transport business, other than containerships, that each generates profits in the tens of billions of yen, such as dry bulkers, tankers, car carriers, and LNG carriers. We will also create non-marine transport business with these levels of profits, including the offshore, real estate, and logistics businesses. Our immediate goal is to establish these profit levels so that we can realize profits of ¥100.0 billion or more even in unfavorable conditions and profits in excess of ¥200.0 billion when business in volatile markets perform well.

![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)

## Reforming Our Business Portfolio to Build a More Sustainable, Stable Corporate Entity

While the absolute amounts of profits are of course one focus, the stability of business performance is also important. In reducing the degree to which market conditions impact business performance and creating a structure that can consistently generate stable profits, reform of our business portfolio is unavoidable. With this in mind, we have included in Rolling Plan 2022 a Portfolio Strategy that targets raising the profits of non-marine transport businesses—mainly offshore, logistics, real estate, and projects related to the offshore wind power generation business—from fiscal 2021's result of approximately ¥14.0 billion to between ¥60.0 billion and ¥80.0 billion by fiscal 2025.

A feature of marine transport, which is the Group's core business, is the significant performance volatility caused by fluctuations in economic and market conditions. Among our marine transport businesses, this volatility is particularly pronounced in such areas as containerships, dry bulkers, tankers, and car carriers. Given the robust profitability of these businesses when they are doing well and our social mission to support global economic activities, these businesses will remain core businesses. On the other hand, among the same marine transport businesses, the LNG carrier business, the methanol carrier business, and other businesses mainly based on long-term contracts have relatively low profit margins but generate stable cash flows over the long term. Therefore, by growing such businesses so that they account for a greater share of profits, we will mitigate performance fluctuations in our marine transport businesses as a whole. Further, as the third pillar of our approach, we will increase the relative weight in our business portfolio of domains such as logistics and real estate, whose performances are affected by factors that are completely different from those that affect the performances of marine transport businesses. We will become a corporate group that can generate consistent profits by building a well-balanced business portfolio based on three major pillars: high-risk, high-return marine transport; long-term stable marine transport; and non-marine transport, such as real estate, warehousing, and offshore businesses.

With our sights set on establishing the aforementioned business portfolio structure, in January 2022 we implemented tender offers for DAIBIRU CORPORATION and Utec Corporation, which were listed subsidiaries, and then made them into wholly owned subsidiaries. Both of these companies have long histories and have established strong positions in their respective business fields. I am confident that the companies will be able to achieve even greater growth by incorporating MOL's network and global business experience and, if required, MOL's capital strength. Particularly in Asia, which is a target region of our Regional Strategy, we anticipate burgeoning demand for the real estate services offered by DAIBIRU and the heavy goods transport services that are Utec's specialty. By capturing demand for these services, we intend to maximize both companies' growth potential.

In addition, as we continue developing in fields beyond traditional business models, the extension of our roles in supply chains from existing roles in the marine transport field to roles in upstream and downstream supply chain fields will open up a wider range of earning opportunities for us. In the marine transport business, in order to meet the needs of customers, we need to propose optimal transport methods based on an in-depth understanding of the customer's entire business. In the process, we will gain a detailed and extensive knowledge of the cargo being transported, the related industries, and the structures of businesses in the supply chain beyond the marine transport field. Historically, supply chain functions have gradually become specialized and discrete. However, I feel that there is scope for optimization of these functions through the provision of more-integrated services that extend beyond MOL's mainstay marine transport field to encompass upstream and downstream fields, such as warehousing, real estate, and logistics. This approach is also related to the Regional Strategy that I will explain shortly. In particular, plans call for growing businesses in partnership with conglomerates and state-owned enterprises in India, China, and Southeast Asia. Nothing is written in alone to the effect that these entities only seek business relationships with MOL that are limited to transport. Since such countries have certain barriers to entry and business relationships with local companies cannot be created overnight, we will establish a business model that makes the most of the favorable reputation we have cultivated so far in terms of reliability, technological capabilities, and safety to venture into the joint operation of an array of businesses that are not limited to marine transport.

## Evolving Businesses by Combining Environmental and Regional Strategies

In addition to the Portfolio Strategy, the Environmental and Regional strategies will be important drivers of business development going forward. With regard to the Environmental Strategy, given current overall social trends, demand for goods and services that address environmental issues is likely to increase in various fields, including renewable energy and environmental protection. Accordingly, MOL aims to seize the business opportunities stemming from such demand. As part of these efforts, in fiscal 2021 we embarked upon our first investment in the offshore wind power generation business, a business field that has a strong affinity with our knowledge of offshore operations. This business is in a field that companies from various peripheral industries, such as electric utilities and engineering, are endeavoring to enter with an eye on the market's growth potential, but we believe that there are sure to be business opportunities that a marine transport company can capture by utilizing its personnel and expertise. Specific areas in which we could establish businesses include the installation and maintenance of power generation facilities or the acquisition of floating offshore wind power generation facilities to enter into the power generation business. We want to actively develop such business opportunities because their realization will both address social issues and increase our growth potential.

Further, Rolling Plan 2022 earmarks an additional ¥360.0 billion for environmental investment over the next three fiscal years—up significantly from that of the previous Rolling Plan. With this investment, we will expand our low- and zero-emission energy businesses, including the offshore wind power generation business, and evolve our existing marine transport businesses by developing a fleet that uses alternative fuels to reduce our GHG emissions. In this way, we will be able to continue providing services that are both socially sustainable and the preferred choice of customers.

Next, I will turn to our Regional Strategy. Traditionally, our sales organization has been vertically divided according to vessel type. In this business model, for instance, the car carrier business is run by the Car Carrier Division, while the LNG carrier business is run by the LNG Carrier Division, with each division located in the Tokyo Head Office and developing separate operations around the world. This way of organizing businesses has certain advantages in terms of promoting expertise and efficiency. However, even if one division works hard and manages to establish a business relationship with a major customer in one country, other divisions may be focusing efforts on another country with higher priority for them. Consequently, the Group may not fully utilize painstakingly established bridgeheads. Therefore, I want to build a structure that can spread the benefits of such hard-won positions across the organization. Although our development of this type of organization is still incomplete, over the past few years we have been introducing a system whereby the Corporate Marketing Division, chief executive representatives, and chief country representatives take a more comprehensive approach.

![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)

to regions that are not restricted by the divisional boundaries. By advancing this approach even further and implementing initiatives ahead of those for other regions, we are developing an "India model" (i.e. page 21). In fiscal 2022, we have appointed to the new position of executive officer in charge of South Asia and the Middle East an Indian officer who is conversant with local conditions and delegated authority on matters related to regional business development to this officer. We are initiating this type of structural change because the creation of a system in which the officer with regional responsibility is given discretion and flexibility is essential if we are to realize our Regional Strategy of jointly operating a range of businesses by becoming the trusted partner of local companies in each country.

The first reason why we have chosen India as a target is the scale of the country's market. There is ample scope to establish similar structures in countries such as Indonesia, where we have been engaged in businesses for many years, and the Philippines, which is a major supplier of crew members. Given the resources that need to be committed, however, we wanted to begin by tackling a large-scale market. A second reason for selecting India is that, while various barriers to entry remain, once business foundations have been established and become entrenched in the country and its market, we will be able to leverage this position to expand other businesses. As we have a track record of doing business with Indian customers in the fields of tankers and LNG carriers, we want to extend these business activities to include car carriers and dry bulkers. We are not yet at the stage of being able to set specific targets for sales and profits, but the goal is to quickly grow operations to a scale where 30 to 40 India-based vessels are continuously transporting cargo to the country. If this endeavor is successful, we will introduce the model to the markets of other countries and regions, including Southeast Asia, China, Brazil, and Africa.

#### **Review of the Management Plans**

**– Achievements since Introducing the Rolling Plan**

#### **Progress since Introducing the Rolling Plan**

In fiscal 2017, we stopped using medium-term management plans, replacing them with a rolling management plan. First, we set out a 10-Year Vision. We then created a plan by backcasting from this vision and revised the plan by checking progress each year. By fiscal 2021, after revising the plan in this way five times, we achieved the financial strength targets that were set for fiscal 2027. Moreover, the prospect of reaching the fiscal 2027 profit targets was within sight, and we realized the portfolio reform and stronger market resilience initially sought. As such, we have decided that Rolling Plan 2022 will be the last management plan focused on the fiscal 2027 targets. By the beginning of fiscal 2023, we will prepare a new management plan targeting a vision for fiscal 2035.

![img-11.jpeg](img-11.jpeg)

#### **Rolling Plan 2022—A Bridge to the Next Management Plan**

Strong performances in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 have markedly improved MOL's financial position, investment capacity, and management options. In addition, we must meet society's ever-increasing expectations of companies in relation to decarbonization and other issues. Under these circumstances, we have decided to spend fiscal 2022 formulating a robust management plan that is not an extension of our previous plan and which reflects new realities. In the meantime, we will continue fiscal 2021's forward-looking measures and integrate them with the initiatives of the new plan.

# Rolling Plan 2022

## Theme and the Three Growth Strategies of Rolling Plan 2022

Under the theme of "Integrating the MOL Group's strengths to achieve growth globally," Rolling Plan 2022 sets out three growth strategies—Portfolio, Environmental, and Regional. The Portfolio Strategy calls for strengthening of non-shipping businesses to improve the stability of the Group's profits.

Under the Environmental Strategy, we will accelerate the initiatives set forth in MOL Group Environmental Vision 2.1. Meanwhile, the Regional Strategy will involve establishing a stronger presence in priority countries and regions by adopting an "India model" (i)pages 16 to 21).

![img-16.jpeg](img-16.jpeg)

## Initiatives Based on Both Rolling Plan 2022 and the MOL Sustainability Plan

In fiscal 2022, we reorganized existing initiatives for Sustainability Issues (Materiality) to formulate the MOL Sustainability Plan—a more concrete plan that specifies KPIs and action plans (i)pgage AD, in addition, to emphasize our commitment to addressing social issues through our businesses.

![img-17.jpeg](img-17.jpeg)

## Rolling Plan 2022: Investment Plan

Given our increased investment capacity between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024 in terms of cash outflows, we plan to invest ¥1.0 trillion, which includes ¥730.0 billion of newly earmarked investments.

As well as significantly increasing our three-year environmental investment to ¥530.0 billion between fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2024 from the prior ¥200.0 billion between fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2023 in Rolling Plan 2021, we will explore M&A opportunities, particularly among the non-shipping businesses in line with our three growth strategies.

## Rolling Plan 2022: Profit Plan and Cash Flow Forecast

Against the backdrop of a booming containership market, in fiscal 2022 we are expecting a high level of ordinary profit, second only to that of fiscal 2021. At the end of July 2022, we upwardly revised the ordinary profit forecast to ¥710.0 billion, compared with a forecast of ¥525.0 billion issued at the end of April 2022. However, given the anticipated normalization of logistics as well as the delivery of a large number of new containerships, we are targeting ordinary profit in the ¥140.0 billion to ¥145.0 billion range from fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2024. Thereafter, we will realize recurring profit of ¥200.0 billion by fiscal 2027, based mainly on growth in the LNG carrier, offshore, car carrier, and real property businesses coupled with a recovery in the containership business. In addition, we will seek an overall balance between investing cash flows and operating cash flows, thereby exercising financial discipline even while actively investing (i)pgage (i)g.

## Portfolio Strategy—Basic Aims

Under **Rolling Plan 2022**, in addition to advancing our traditional core shipping business, we aim to strengthen non-shipping businesses and grow their profits from the fiscal 2021 level of approximately ¥16.0 billion to between ¥60.0 billion and ¥80.0 billion by fiscal 2025. By strengthening business fields with market characteristics that differ from the volatility of the shipping market, the MOL Group will diversify its portfolio and accumulate stable profits.

The real property business and the logistics business were bolstered by the inclusion of **DAIBIRU CORPORATION** and **Utoc Corporation** in the MOL Group as wholly owned subsidiaries in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.

The Group will give both subsidiaries central roles in its non-shipping businesses, which the Group will expand by utilizing management resources even more effectively. In the offshore business, the Group will step up investment in non-transport businesses that it has been advancing for some time, such as **FDRUs**, **LNG-to-Powerships**, and **Carbon Capture**, **Utilization**, and **Storage** (CCUS). Meanwhile, the offshore wind power generation business and related businesses are proactively marketing in Japan and overseas to capture demand related to the trend toward decarbonization.

As for alternative energy sources such as hydrogen and ammonia, we will not only develop businesses targeting future transport demand but also explore investment opportunities upstream in the supply chain, thereby achieving multifaceted expansion of our portfolio.

Also, we aim to strengthen the structural resilience of the shipping business even further so that it generates stable profits while minimizing the impact of market conditions. To this end, we will achieve an appropriate balance between highly volatile businesses—such as the dry bulk, car carrier, and containership businesses—and businesses with stable earnings and high market resilience such as the **LNG carrier** business.

In accordance with our investment plan, we will achieve targets through continued aggressive investment in non-shipping business fields. As part of these initiatives, the MOL Group will invest at least ¥100.0 billion in the real property business between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024. The Group will further capitalize on its global network to augment **DAIBIRU's** overseas business development. At the same time, the shipping business will proactively invest, including investment to introduce vessels that use alternative fuels.

## Examples of Initiatives

### Tender Offers for DAIBIRU and Utoc and the Introduction of Group Executive Officers

On November 30, 2021, MOL announced tender offers for **DAIBIRU** and **Utoc**, and both companies had become wholly owned subsidiaries by April 2022. While both companies have been members of the MOL Group for many years, they were also listed in the **First Section** of the **Tokyo Stock Exchange**. Consequently, their positions in the MOL Group's management strategy have been somewhat marginal until now. Making both companies wholly owned subsidiaries will enable the Group to optimize the allocation of management resources in line with its management strategy. In addition, **DAIBIRU** and **Utoc** will be able to grow globally by capitalizing on the networks of the Group and capturing the latent needs of its customers.

In April 2022, a new system was introduced that appoints the presidents of the Group's five core companies to the position of Group executive officer, which is a Head Office executive officer position. The Group companies in question are **DAIBIRU**, **Utoc**, **MOL Drybulik Ltd.**, **MOL Chemical Tankers Pte. Ltd.**, and **MOL Information Systems, Ltd**. By placing these Group companies on the same level as the Head Office sales divisions, the new system will enable prompt decision-making, thereby strengthening the management of the Group.

In addition to the aforementioned Group executive officer system, the MOL Group will take wide-ranging measures to strengthen its business management. For example, the Group will increase the organic links between its management strategies and those of Group companies to facilitate cohesive Groupwide drives toward the targets of **Rolling Plan 2022** and the **MOL Sustainability Plan**.

### Concerted Initiative Focused on Offshore Wind Power Generation-Related Businesses

The supply chain for offshore wind power generation, which is attracting attention as a promising alternative power source that can support decarbonization efforts, comprises many fields where the MOL Group can leverage its experience in marine transport and offshore businesses. Specific fields include the transport of materials and equipment, power-cable laying, wind turbine installation, power generation, equipment maintenance, and personnel recruitment and training. As for the offshore wind power generation business, which is the core of the supply chain, we began investing and participating in and dispatched a director to a working offshore wind power generation project in Taiwan in 2021. The aim of our foray into this segment of the supply chain is to rapidly acquire knowledge of the overall operational management and profit structures of the offshore wind power generation business that we can use in further development going forward. In addition, we have already established a joint venture with a major partner in Japan with a view to participation in power generation projects.

In peripheral fields, we have acquired a stake in a company that operates five self-releasing platform (SEP) vessels, which install power generation equipment. The company is currently involved in work off the coast of Noshiro.

# Environmental Strategy

**The naming and launching ceremony of the ASAMF, the world's first pure battery tanker**

## Environmental Strategy—Basic Aims

Formulated in June 2021, MOL Group Environmental Vision 2.1 establishes three medium- to long-term targets: deploy net zero emissions, size-deploying vessels in the 2020s, reduce GHG emissions, intensify by approximately 45.0% by 2025 (compared with 2019), and achieve net zero GHG emissions for the entire Group by 2050. To achieve these targets, the Group is steadily implementing various initiatives. Of the cumulative total investment of €1.3 trillion projected for the three-year period from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2024 under Rolling Plan 2022, €530.0 billion has been earmarked for investments in vessels that use alternative fuels as well as in low-carbon and decarbonization initiatives. These investments represent increases in terms of both scale and share compared with Rolling Plan 2021, which called for the allocation to low-carbon and decarbonization initiatives of €205.0 billion relative to a total investment of €450.0 billion.

We will proactively invest to introduce vessels that use alternative fuels and achieve the medium- to long-term goals of MOL Group Environmental Vision 2.1. Issues remain to be addressed, such as how to overcome the combined impact of a hike in shipbuilding costs—which is accompanying the current increases in the prices of steel and other materials—and the additional costs associated with the introduction of vessels that use alternative fuels. Nonetheless, we will take advantage of the significant improvement in our financial position since fiscal 2020 to systematically develop our fleet. For the time being, the majority of our newbuild orders will be for LNG-fueled vessels. However, given that ammonia is expected to be used as a next-generation fuel, the Company will participate in the technological development of ammonia-fueled vessels and actively work toward the early introduction of such vessels and expansion of the fleet.

As well as fuel conversion, we will work on multiple fronts to realize a GHG emission reduction road map. Depending on the characteristics of each vessel type, we will introduce energy-saving technologies that use wind as propulsion, such as the Wind Challenger hard sail system (I-Jepage 56) and Rotor Sail, and other energy-saving devices.

Worldwide, the Group's low- and zero-emission energy businesses will contribute to society's low-carbon and decarbonization initiatives. At the same time, these businesses will compensate for the decline in demand for the transport of oil and coal by expanding the Group's fleet of LNG and ammonia carriers, which are likely to see growth in transport demand, and by moving forward with investments in the offshore wind power generation business and in peripheral fields.

Lowering carbon and decarbonization is a common global challenge as well as a challenge for customers with whom we have built long-standing relationships. By becoming a solution provider and partner, we will capture new business opportunities.

## Examples of Initiatives

### Introduction of ICP

In fiscal 2021, MOL began the use of ICP as a means of advancing a transition plan based on MOL Group Environmental Vision 2.1. In anticipation of future carbon taxes, emissions trading, and other charges, fixed monetary amounts per ton of CO2 emissions are set as internal carbon prices, which are used as economic indicators when making investment decisions (CO2 cost: US$40 per ton from 2023 to 2039 and US$140 per ton beginning from 2040). Required to be applied to all investment projects related to the oceangoing marine transport business, the internal carbon prices have already been used in decisions on and in the practical management of more than 10 investments since the introduction of this system.

### Examples of ICP Use

ICP has been used in investment projects such as LNG-fueled vessels and the Wind Challenger hard sail system and had a positive effect on decision-making. While low-carbon and decarbonization initiatives usually incur additional costs, ICP shortens envisioned return on investment periods by converting CO2 emission reductions into monetary benefits, thereby encouraging investment.

### Realization of a 5.0% Reduction in Fuel Consumption by the End of 2024 through Operating Efficiency

In April 2022, the Environment & Sustainability Strategy Division formed a dedicated team that is tasked with further enhancing operating efficiency and comprises personnel with experience in ship operations, technical personnel, and sea-based employees.

Through collaboration with Akishima Laboratories (Mitsui Zosen) Inc. and MOL Techno-Trade, Ltd., and the utilization of EcoMOL Inc., which was established in the Philippines in May 2022, MOL is aiming for a total improvement in fuel efficiency of 5.0%. We will achieve 3.0% of this improvement through measures for intangible aspects of operational practices, mainly focused on realizing rigorously efficient operations through the optimization of routing and power output. The remaining 2.0% will be realized through hardware-related measures, including the use of low-friction hull paint, effective hull maintenance, installation of energy-saving equipment, and propeller replacement. In all of the aforementioned initiatives, the key will be the visualization and utilization of vast amounts of data from respective operating vessels, which is being conducted by the FOCUS project (I-Jepage 56).

We have already begun this initiative for approximately 180 operating vessels, and we plan to extend it to cover 500 operating vessels. Serving as the nucleus of the initiative, the dedicated team will coordinate with related parties to reduce GHG emissions and operating costs by beginning with the advancement of fuel consumption reduction measures that will be immediately beneficial.

## Emission, Hydrogen, and Methanation Initiatives

While promoting the introduction of LNG-fueled vessels as a feasible means of lowering GHG emissions right now, we are conducting extensive studies on ammonia, hydrogen, and other promising candidates for the decarbonized fuels of the future.

# **Regional Strategy**

**1. Focusing on Asia but without being limited to transport, take advantage of the MSS, Group's collective strength to acquire large-scale projects**

The product leader LILAC-WITORIA, which began providing India-based services for China customers in March 2021.

## **Regional Strategy—Basic Aims**

Having positioned the Regional Strategy as one of its core growth strategies since the preparation of Rolling Plan 2021, the MSS, Group has sought to acquire large-scale projects by taking advantage of its collective strength and focused on Asia, without being limited to transport. The goal is to increase business opportunities by developing Group company businesses as well as new businesses through the utilization of relationships that MSS has built with customers, partners, and other stakeholders around the world.

In fiscal 2021, we identified Asia—where growth is expected—as the most important region for us. In particular, we actively developed businesses in India, focusing on the energy field. Given that Asia is integral to the advancement of our Regional Strategy, we further strengthened our business execution capabilities in the region in fiscal 2022. Based on a west–east division of the region comprising Asia, the Middle East, and Oceania, we have established new executive officer positions dedicated to the promotion of sales in East Asia, Southeast Asia, Oceania, and the South Asia–Middle East region, respectively. To the latter region, we have appointed Ajay Singh, a managing executive officer who is well versed in local conditions.

Under the strong leadership of regional executive officers, we will accurately grasp changing customer needs and establish capabilities for offering solutions based on organic collaboration among local sales bases, Group companies, and business divisions. Focusing on India, we will use these capabilities to acquire large-scale projects in South Asia and the Middle East.

The Group has also strengthened its global network in countries and regions other than India. In 2016, we introduced a system of chief country/regional representatives, who are now working in 25 countries and regions. Further, to support new initiatives in each country and region, the Head Office's Corporate Marketing Division has been playing a central role in the implementation of the "lead sprints" system (-)epage 211 since fiscal 2021. This system is enabling us to expedite decision-making and thereby cater appropriately to customer needs in each country and region.

In the same way that we identified India as a priority country, we will select additional priority countries and regions, which will then become focuses of our Regional Strategy going forward. In selecting countries and regions, we will comprehensively consider growth potential and market size in light of macroeconomic indicators as well as the historical foundations that we have built up over many years.

Our investment plan establishes cumulative M&A budgets of ¥100.0 billion for fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2024 and ¥300.0 billion for fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2027. Accordingly, we will actively utilize M&As as a means of expanding businesses in regions.

## **Examples of Initiatives**

### **India Model: Supporting the Regional Strategy**

**Coordination among the regional executive officer, chief country representatives, and the Corporate Marketing Division**

In 2015, with the aim of accurately catering to customer needs, at four bases worldwide we established chief executive representatives who oversee regions. Since then, we have been strengthening Groupwide intra-regional collaboration. In 2016, we introduced chief country/regional representatives to countries where we wanted to concentrate sales efforts and then began offering comprehensive transport solutions that reflected the circumstances in each country and region. Also, in fiscal 2021 we appointed chief country representatives in the United States, Russia, the Netherlands, and Kenya.

In addition, in order to support the development of new businesses in each region, through the "lead sprints" system, we encourage the use of not only the existing customer networks of the Head Office sales divisions but also the newly established networks that have been built by the chief executive representatives and chief country/regional representatives. In this way, we support the multifaceted search for potential opportunities that match the Regional Strategy outlined in Rolling Plan 2021 and Rolling Plan 2022.

In Rolling Plan 2021, the Regional Strategy identified Asia as the Group's highest priority region. Accordingly, placing particular emphasis on developing businesses in India, we won new contracts for VLCCs and LPG carriers for Indian customers. These achievements are an example of realizing new business by discovering customer needs through the initiative of a local office and by providing support from a Head Office sales division.

Under Rolling Plan 2022, we have further strengthened such efforts by introducing a system whereby the Head Office and the regional base work in tandem to advance respective businesses in India. For each business, a joint task force is established by the Head Office sales divisions and the regional executive officer / chief executive representative of South Asia and the Middle East region.

Until now, each Head Office sales division has had its own overseas bases and conducted sales and business activities on a divisional basis. In India, however, the provision of information on each business in the country is focused on the regional executive officer / chief executive representative, who leads the Regional Strategy from a cross-business viewpoint. This "India model" is an experimental initiative for us. Through a process of trial and error, we will create better systems that suit both sales divisions and regional bases. If the India model proves successful, we plan to introduce it to other priority countries and regions.

**India Model**

- 11 Bases information, consult, and reads decisions.
- 5 Gained the discussion and/or report.

### **"Lead Sprints" System**

One of the key measures of the Regional Strategy initiated by Rolling Plan 2021, the "lead sprints" system began operating as a forum for accelerating discussions on the direction of potential new projects. Separated from the existing bottom-up decision-making process that begins from the Head Office business divisions, the "lead sprints" system allows the senior management team to monitor projects soon after they have begun deliberations and check the direction of initiatives. Our aim is to enable regional executives—namely, regional executive officers / chief executive representatives and chief country representatives—to unerringly secure promising projects that are in line with management policies, even in a rapidly changing business environment.

In the first half of fiscal 2022, the executive officers, chief executive representatives, and chief country representatives in charge of North America, Europe and Africa, and Asia discussed 40 potential target projects that were considered promising by the officers and representatives in charge of each region from a Companywide perspective. The CEO and other members of the senior management team then joined the discussions and narrowed down the projects, selecting a list of 10 projects on which resource investment will focus.

## Enhancement of Organizational Strength, Work-Style Reforms, and Safety

### Enhancement of Organizational Strength: Launch of a Human Resource Plan

Rolling Plan 2022 calls on MOL to establish a new human resource plan. As one of the pillars of the Company's next management plan, the new human resource plan will indicate the basic strategies for measures aimed at strengthening the Group's human resource base from a medium- to long-term perspective.

We have already taken some human resource measures. In fiscal 2021, we reassigned 66 personnel to business fields such as the low-carbon and decarbonization fields, which are priority investment targets. Also, we increased the hiring of technical personnel and other experienced personnel, recruiting 24 personnel in fiscal 2021.

As for fiscal 2022, we are hiring more personnel to manage proactive investment initiatives. In particular, we have revised the frequency of our mid-career hiring, and began recruiting experienced personnel year-round from fiscal 2022.

In the April 2022 reassignment of senior management team members, three non-Head Office personnel were appointed as division general managers. One of these general managers is a non-Japanese employee from a MOL Group company who has been appointed to head the Global Maritime Resources Division. This newly established division plans human resource policies for the worldwide recruitment of sea-based employees, who fulfill a fundamental role in the Group's businesses by ensuring safe operation.

With a view to clarifying the wide range of needs in relation to human resource policy and formulating a new human resource plan, the Chief Human Resource Officer—a position that was created in April 2022—has been holding discussions with domestic Group companies and the Head Office sales divisions. Going forward, we will incorporate into the human resource plan the appointment and promotion of personnel in accordance with the principle of the right person for the right job, including employees working at Group companies and in overseas businesses. Other focuses of the plan will be the strengthening of support for career development so that employees can fully realize their potential and the provision of work-style options that cater to employees' diverse needs.

By increasing its appeal to talented personnel and increasing their engagement, the Group will achieve enhancement of organizational strength.

## Digital Transformation (DX)

### DX Vision Workshop

In the second half of fiscal 2022, we plan to announce the MOL DX Vision, which will establish a framework for our long-term DX strategy. To lay the foundations for this vision, in June 2022 we held a two-day workshop attended by 40 participants, including Executive Committee members up to the rank of CEO, and selected members from each division, the DX Co-Creation Unit, and external partners. We began by discussing the MOL Group's long-term target profile based on the future vision of the Company and the industry. Backcasting from this profile, we then determined what is required of DX and prepared a draft of the MOL DX Vision accordingly. After conducting additional in-depth discussions that involve a wide range of employees, we will formulate a final version of the vision, which will guide the advancement of DX. Based on the new vision, the Group will step up the pace of existing DX initiatives.

## A Message from the CFO

![img-29.jpeg](img-29.jpeg)

In fiscal 2021, ended March 31, 2022, MOL broke its net income record for the first time since fiscal 2007 by posting profit attributable to owners of parent of ¥708.8 billion. This performance was supported by high containership freight rates, a good dry bulker market particularly on small- and medium-sized vessels, and a recovery in car carrier cargo volume. These market conditions were brought about the global disruption to supply chains triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. While we are not happy about this situation, in fiscal 2021 we achieved the financial targets that we had been pursuing since the introduction of the Rolling Plan in fiscal 2017. These achievements included significant improvement in the equity ratio from 27.6% at the end of fiscal 2020 to 47.6%, the regaining of an 'X' crediting rating from R&I, and a net gearing ratio below 1.0 time.

Fiscal 2021 was also a year in which we used operating cash flows of more than ¥300.0 billion, which included dividends from the containership operating company Ocean Network Express Pte. Ltd. (ONG), to implement a range of forward-looking investments in line with the strategies of our management plan. We initiated tender offers for DAIBIRIU CORPORATION and Uloc Corporation with the aim of making them wholly owned subsidiaries and invested in LNG carriers for which new contracts had been concluded. With respect to shareholder returns, we were able to reward shareholders for their long-standing support by paying a dividend of ¥1,200.00 per share (before the stock split).

![img-30.jpeg](img-30.jpeg)

## Investment Policy and Cash Allocation from Fiscal 2022 Onward

With the dramatic improvement in our financial position, as CFO I am very much aware of the significant responsibility I bear in regard to the effective utilization of accumulated shareholders' equity to further enhance corporate value. Themed on "Integrating the MOL Group's strengths to achieve growth globally," Rolling Plan 2022 calls for corporate value enhancement through the investment of ¥1.9 trillion between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2027 in order to increase future corporate value. Through these investments, we will work to facilitate the stable achievement of ordinary profit of ¥200.0 billion and return on equity (ROE) of 10.0%, which is above our perceived cost of capital. Moreover, the investments will curb the volatility that characterizes marine transport, which stems from exposure to cyclical market conditions.

Specifically, we will invest in three main areas: the introduction of vessels that use alternative fuels; the expansion of low- and zero-emission energy businesses; and the expansion of business range and assets including M&As. In all of these areas, we are advancing many projects that are either industry leading or one step beyond the existing business domain of our full-line marine transport. As they have been selected with an eye on leveraging accumulated expertise and experience as well as relationships with major partners, these projects will provide significant opportunities for us to elevate corporate value. On the other hand, given that such projects are in fields characterized by high levels of difficulty and uncertainty compared with our well-established businesses in conventional marine transport and that we are tackling more projects in India, Southeast Asia, and other emerging countries and regions, we must ensure that our financial base will hold firm even if certain risk events actualize.

Conducting business management with an emphasis on financial discipline, for the time being we will set an upper limit of 1.0 time for the net gearing ratio, a level that was once our target. In addition, vessels chartered from shipowners, whose main business is the ownership of vessels, are integral to marine transport. For this reason, roughly 500 of the approximately 800 vessels in our fleet are chartered vessels. Pursuant with Japan's accounting standards, most chartered vessels are not recognized in our balance sheet. Nonetheless, with the aim of further increasing transparency from the viewpoint of investors, we will take medium-term measures to improve disclosure methods and other matters related to such chartered vessels.

As for investment criteria, we employ a system that uses past market performance as the basis for forecasting the maximum potential loss for each project. With respect to an investment amount, cost of equity is applied to the maximum potential loss amount, and cost of debt is applied to the remaining amount (i. p. p. p. 27). The system prevents the Company as a whole from taking on too much risk while ensuring each investment project has a certain spread over the assumed amounts of equity and debt. Further, even with respect to chartered vessels for which the balance sheet is not actually used, the system employs the same approach to apply an appropriate cost of capital to investments. By accumulating assets in accordance with this system, we ensure returns commensurate with the cost of capital.

## **>Y Approach to Shareholder Returns**

As one of the world's leading providers of marine transport and social infrastructure, we give first priority to the creation of additional economic and social value through the active reinvestment of internal reserves. On the other hand, rewarding shareholders directly through dividends and other means is also important. Our profit plan issued at the beginning of fiscal 2022 includes a dividend forecast based on a dividend payout ratio of 25.0%. While some investors have expressed appreciation of a raised dividend payout ratio when profits are expected to remain at fiscal 2021's high level, others have expressed dissatisfaction because, despite an improved financial position, the Company has yet to reach the average dividend payout ratio of the Tokyo Stock Exchange's Prime Market. In our view, we have entered a new phase. Although the overall direction of business management has been established, we aim to spend fiscal 2022 preparing a new management plan that looks ahead to 2035. To this end, we will continue heightening the accuracy of our analysis of the long-term business environment in light of decarbonization trends and the increasingly complex current international situation. Based on our conclusions, we will conduct a more detailed examination of individual investment projects and the outlook for capital requirements. Therefore, we would be extremely grateful for a little more time to discuss shareholder returns so that we can present a cohesive policy in this regard.

In closing, I would like to ask our shareholders, investors, and financial institutions for their continued support.

## **>A Approach to Cross-Shareholdings**

MDL holds shares in other companies for the purpose of maintaining and strengthening relationships with companies with which it has close cooperative business relationships and for the purpose of enhancing the growth and corporate value of the Company over the medium to long term. Once a year, a detailed examination of each listed stock held by the Company is conducted with respect to the appropriateness of the reason for holding the shares and profitability in light of the cost of capital. If an adequate reason for holding the shares cannot be identified, the Company's policy is to gradually reduce the holdings of said shares. The fiscal 2022 examination of 47 stocks, equivalent to approximately ¥56.0 billion, which were owned by the Company as of March 31, 2022, determined that a portion equivalent to approximately ¥8.0 billion was to be subject to reduction. The Company will proceed with the disposal of the shares while ascertaining the effect on the market and giving due consideration to relationships with other parties.

## **Cross-Shareholdings: Number and as a Percentage of Net Assets**

|  Number | As a percentage of net assets (c)  |
| --- | --- |
|  0 | 0.0%  |
|  1 | 1.7%  |

|  10 | 4.0%  |
|  11 | 4.7%  |

## **Disposal of Cross-Shareholdings by Fiscal Year**

![img-32.jpeg](img-32.jpeg)

## **High Risk Changes in Investment Decisions**

When Asset Risk Control was first introduced, the lack of direct linkage between the system and the profitability benchmarks that the Company uses to make new investment decisions was an issue. Through subsequent revisions, the framework has been improved so that the funding costs in profitability assessments vary depending on the size of risk exposure, which is calculated based on the current concepts of the Asset Risk Control system. In other words, internal evaluations of ship investment projects now take into consideration the maximum potential loss in line with the amount of risk associated with the ship and apply equity cost for this portion, while debt cost is applied in the risk-free portion. In this way, the higher the risk associated with a ship, the higher the funding cost associated with it, and the investment is not approved unless profitability is sufficiently high to compensate for this risk. Based on this approach, investment projects that consume a large amount of Comparewide investment (seway (remaining amount of risks that can be added) naturally face high hurdle rates, and projects that require fewer resources face lower hurdles to approval. The framework ultimately leads to an overall portfolio that balances risks against returns. Further, the framework helps secure a certain level of ROE by only adopting individual investment projects with a certain spread over the specific weighted average cost of capital based on a deemed ratio of equity cost to debt cost. In addition, as the rapid accumulation of shareholders' equity accompanying a favorable fiscal 2021 performance has resulted in additional scope for the assumption of risk, the Company will aggressively pursue investment projects that contribute to growth.

Supported by Market Conditions and a Recovery in Cargo Movements, Posted Unprecedented Profits in Fiscal 2021, Mainly in the Containership Business Throughout fiscal 2021, the strong demand in the containership market of the previous fiscal year continued. As a result, equity in earnings of affiliates from Ocean Network Express Pte. Ltd. (ONE), which operates the containership business, drove MOL's profits above their previous record high, achieved during a boom in marine transport in the mid-2000s. As for fiscal 2022, due to an economic downturn caused by global inflation and other factors, we forecast that the containership market will enter an adjustment phase in the middle of the fiscal year.

The car carrier business also recovered strongly. The direct cause of this recovery was a tightening of the market due to fleet size reductions implemented by MOL and other shipping companies until fiscal 2021 and a subsequent recovery in transport demand. However, the base level of profits was also raised by the progress of a regional strategy in China and India, various structural reforms, and improvements in the efficiency of ship allocation.

In the ferry business, although the business environment in the passenger sector remained challenging amid the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for freight transport was resilient. Consequently, business results were around the breakeven point.

The combination of the aforementioned performances of the containership and car carrier businesses together with solid contributions to profits from the terminal & logistics and real property businesses resulted in the Headquarters of Product Transport & Real Property Business as a whole achieving excellent business results in the fiscal year.

### Pursuing Synergies among Businesses by Thinking Outside the Box

Looking to the future from our current position of strength, we face a range of risks and uncertainties. In the short term, potential causes for concern include a slowdown of the global economy, which has achieved a steep recovery since the easing of restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; an increase in the turmoil resulting from the Russia-Ukraine situation; a sharp depreciation of the yen; and a hike in energy prices. Factors that could have negative long-term impacts are the possibility of surplus shipping capacity due to a rush to build new vessels, higher operating costs stemming from the introduction of the European Union Emissions Trading System and other environmental regulations, concerns about the establishment of a market oligopoly as European shipping companies acquire logistics companies, lower container cargo movements accompanying a decline in demand for goods, and the formation of economic blocs as a result of an increase in the local manufacturing of products for local consumption.

To steadily grow businesses despite such potential adversity, we view "networks" as a key word. Although the Headquarters of Product Transport & Real Property Business has a diverse business portfolio encompassing containerships, terminal & logistics, ferries, car carriers, and real estate, the realization of synergies is, at first glance, often assumed to be difficult. However, by building broad networks, each business will be able to not only expand its services but also interact with other businesses in the division and thereby gain access to customers, tap their demand, and offer them differentiated solutions and services. As for the real property business, which was added to the business headquarters in fiscal 2022 as a consequence of DAI BIRU CORPORATION becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of MOL, we will utilize as foundations the customer trust and advanced capabilities in management and maintenance that DAI BIRU has cultivated over many years while making full use of the MOL Group's networks to identify and develop new areas for growth. For example, we will move forward with initiatives in fields where we have previously not had extensive involvement, including real estate development in emerging countries, particularly Asian countries, and logistics-related real estate.

To effectively utilize networks and realize the ambitious initiatives that I mentioned, we must encourage lively communication within the business headquarters and enable each employee to think outside the box without feeling constrained by organizational frameworks. As director general, my mission is to help build such a culture in the business headquarters.

By leveraging the global networks of its businesses, the business headquarters will unearth new customer demand and deliver services that MOL is uniquely qualified to realize.

# Taking on the Challenge of the Overseas Real Property Business through DAIBIRIU

In April 2022, MOL completed a tender offer for DAIBIRIU COMPONENTS, marked by wholly owned subsidiary, Du Further (entrepreneurship and financial services) and the Group endeavors to strengthen the real property business—one of the segments of high priority in Rolling Plan 2022—and aims to expand this business in overseas markets with promising growth.

*Rising and Emerging: The DAIBIRIU-owned Saigon Tower in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam*

## The Story behind Our Overseas Expansion

In 1923, DAIBIRIU was established for the joint construction of a new office building by Osaka Shosen Kaisha (O.S.K. Line), which was a predecessor of MOL, and partner companies. DAIBIRIU subsequently became the owner and manager of numerous prestigious office buildings, primarily in Osaka and Tokyo. Although its business had been stable for many years, the company began to confront a domestic market that lacked growth potential due to Japan's declining population.

Against this backdrop, in the late 2000s we welcomed a new president from MOL who initiated expansions into overseas markets. The decision was made to ride the wave of economic upswing overseas, since demand for office space closely follows economic growth. At the time, China was leading economic growth, but as many companies had already entered this market, the company turned its attention to Vietnam. In addition to a range of elements such as growth potential, cultural affinity with Japan, and political stability, the primary factors leading to the decision to launch a business in Vietnam were MOL's local contacts, many years of business experience in the country, and a wealth of local insights.

However, it was also true that there were voices of concern from some DAIBIRIU employees, as they had never even thought about overseas business, leaving aside the first destination being Vietnam, a developing country. Back in the days when information was rather limited, Vietnam was an unknown, distant country. I remember how the employee assigned to take charge of the new overseas business described that feeling as a strange mix of hope and anxiety.

## Advancing Initiatives in Ho Chi Minh City and Becoming a Successful Overseas Business

In 2007, we began traveling to Vietnam to explore potential projects. Aiming to acquire properties by directly obtaining local information and developing networks, in April 2011 we rented a space in MOL's Ho Chi Minh City office and set up a new representative office staffed by an employee posted from Japan and a locally hired employee. I later took over the position and was put in charge of this fledgling overseas business. Thanks to the support from many different quarters, we acquired our first overseas property, Saigon Tower, from a Hong Kong-based owner in January 2012.

In Japan and overseas, recent years have seen a growing trend toward specialization in the real estate industry. It is common for property owners to outsource external service providers to liaise with tenants and manage properties. The basic approach of DAIBIRIU is, in contrast, to utilize its own resources and those of its group companies to handle development, leasing, lease management, property management, and maintenance in an integrated manner. Whereas many buildings in Vietnam deteriorate significantly soon after completion, the former owner of Saigon Tower, who had a strong attachment to the building, chose to sell it to DAIBIRIU largely due to the company's impressive track record of maintaining and improving the quality of properties in Japan through painstaking management.

Of course, replicating the level of management realized in Japan in another country was not easy. We acquired Saigon Tower through acquiring a local company which owned the building. Our relationship with this company revealed significant differences in approaches to cleaning and security between Japan and Vietnam. After weekly meetings with the executives of the local company, we walked together through the building from top to bottom, inspected the cleanliness and condition of each area, and repeatedly communicated the standards that we sought. The cumulative effect of such minor measures produced positive changes. Gradually, the management standards we were aiming for became widely understood, and the local company began to spontaneously suggest improvements. Today, Saigon Tower is known as one of the best office buildings in Ho Chi Minh City, maintaining a high occupancy rate, and being principally occupied by Western tenants.

In the 10 years since the establishment of our first overseas office, we have entered the real estate markets of Hanoi and Sydney and invested approximately KUS$1 billion. What began with one or two people in the planning department has become a department of overseas business. As well, the goal of earning 10.0% of our operating profit overseas, which initially seemed a distant prospect, is now within sight. DAIBIRIU acquires office buildings in prime locations and then devotes a great deal of time and care to enhance them. I am extremely happy to have been able to demonstrate that this business model also works overseas.

Recently, there has not only been an increase in our export of practices from Japan but also in the introduction of best practices from overseas to domestic businesses. We are currently in the process of introducing a new elevator management system which has not yet been adopted in Japan to our overseas properties. Further, through contact with local tenants and businesses, the overseas business provides opportunities to experience firsthand and remain abreast of such global trends as environmental measures and efforts to meet the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Going forward, we will make more use of experience and insights gained from the overseas business in this way to enhance domestic businesses.

## Developing as a MOL Group Member

In the process of entering overseas markets, being a MOL Group company has been a major asset. For companies in Japan that do not have their own networks, establishing footholds in overseas markets is extremely challenging. It requires a great deal of time and effort to, for example, find and engage consistently largely such basic initial steps as growing understanding of the locality and carrying out inspection tours. In this respect, DAIBIRIU has been able to use MOL offices around the world as a wave for inspections and information hubs to obtain local information from resident MOL employees. Further, while the DAIBIRIU brand is not yet well known in overseas markets, the company has been able to conduct business negotiations and gather information in various countries by taking advantage of MOL's brand name recognition and connections. The recent conversion into a wholly owned subsidiary of MOL will enable DAIBIRIU to further develop overseas businesses by leveraging MOL's brand name and local networks. At the same time, we will benefit MOL's businesses by providing access to information, customers, and business partners that we have acquired locally through the real property business.

## Evolving DAIBIRIU Even Further

When I joined DAIBIRIU about 20 years ago, the possibility of an overseas business was not even considered. I joined DAIBIRIU because I wanted to work in Tokyo or Osaka. Never for a moment did I imagine that I would be consistently engaged in an overseas business. DAIBIRIU has solid business foundations in Osaka and Tokyo. Accordingly, employees tend to focus on stability, but I feel that the development of the overseas business has gradually changed this in-house culture. Nowadays, some employees even join the company because they want to work overseas. Having as many employees as possible gain overseas experience will make us even more robust as a real estate company.

While continuing to evolve further by combining experience as an office-leasing company with its unique position as part of a major shipping group, DAIBIRIU will also contribute by playing key roles in the MOL Group's strategies.

# Participating in the Carbon Business

Since January 2022, the MOL Group has been participating in a blue carbon project that is regenerating and conserving mangrove forests in South Sumatra, Indonesia. Over a period of 30 years, this project aims to remove and store CO2 by planting mangroves on approximately 9,500 hectares of bare land and prevent the emission by conserving 16,000 hectares of existing mangrove forest, which amounts to approximately 11 million tons of CO2 in total. In accordance with MOL Group Environmental Vision 2.1, we will use a range of means to reduce GHG emissions as much as possible while advancing initiatives that create negative emission sources.

## Find an Intersection of Social, Corporate, and Personal Priorities

When studying for a master of business administration qualification with corporate sponsorship, I mulled over the fields where society's expectations, the Company's business, and my own purpose intersect, and which of those fields promised the greatest synergy benefits. I concluded that a blue carbon project was a promising option. Taking into account the decisive importance of this decade for society in terms of climate change, MOL's strong affinity with the ocean and the highly public nature of the Company's business fields, as well as my desire to help realize a society that coexists with nature, I drafted a proposal and submitted it via the corporate venturing program for suggesting new business ideas. In the process of preparing the proposal, I consulted with personnel at various levels of the Company. I found many coworkers with business acumen who understood that the proposal was not simply a corporate social responsibility initiative but rather an initiative in which social benefits and business overlap. Finding these supporters was a major driver of commercialization. Another source of support has been MOL's corporate culture, which commends personnel who, when confronted with uncertainties, determine how much risk can be assumed and then move forward with courage and self-belief.

Currently, we are advancing the project based on a partnership with YL Forest Co., Ltd., which has a track record of mangrove forest conservation in Indonesia. We were introduced to the company by a mangrove expert who helped us with environmental restoration efforts in Mauritius following the WAKASHIO accident in 2020. Our commitment to meeting social responsibilities has led to our relationship with YL Forest, which is an asset that we value.

![img-46.jpeg](img-46.jpeg)

*An on-site inspection in Indonesia*

## Utilize Our Frontline Capabilities

The project is tasked with restoring approximately 1,000 hectares annually over the coming 70 years. At the same time, the project will conduct ongoing activities to conserve existing mangrove forests. At present, we are holding in-depth meetings with YL Forest in preparation for tree planting. The company's main business was originally timber importing. Since transforming into a forest restoration and conservation business in 2004, however, the company has rapidly established an impressive track record and developed various local networks. Therefore, YL Forest will lead local tree-planting activities. However, we will contribute not only as a sponsor but also in relation to project management and negotiations with certification organizations for the issuance of carbon credits, which is another key component of the project.

Currently, companies from a range of industries are attempting to participate in blue carbon projects. However, many such companies seem to be approaching projects to receive carbon credits in return for investing funds as if they were merely financial transactions. By contrast, as a company with various frontline operations as well as operating bases in countries worldwide including marine transport businesses, MOL intends to participate in the project alongside partners on the ground. I believe that this commitment was a key factor in YL Forest's decision to accept us as a partner. In the long run, I believe that our approach will differentiate us from other companies.

In parallel with the preparation for tree planting, we are preparing to conduct a social impact assessment. With the help of external experts, we plan to finalize overall evaluation methods and target indicators by the end of 2022. When measuring the value produced by mangrove forests, carbon storage is currently the most readily understandable indicator, but these forests have long been a source of a wider range of social value that includes contribution to biodiversity and disaster prevention benefits. For the time being, we will work together with local communities on restoration and protection of mangroves while utilizing the economic incentives of carbon credits. In the future, we would also like to introduce symbiotic aquafarming to the mangrove forests so that local residents can enjoy tangible benefits from nature. I hope that this project helps create a society where people coexist with and voluntarily take care of mangrove forests based on a renewed appreciation of their value.

## Remain Needed by Society

Already looking beyond the blue carbon project, the Carbon Business & Project Team, to which I belong, is exploring new projects. We will draw on knowledge garnered from the project in Indonesia, such as the critical aspects of methodologies used in managing blue carbon projects as well as an understanding of mangroves and afterestation, to accurately identify projects with a strong likelihood of succeeding. In addition, our goal is to conduct not only projects that use nature-based solutions but also projects engaged in the development of negative emission technologies that contribute directly to decarbonization through the removal and storage of CO2 from the atmosphere.

We truly want to be a company that remains needed by society far into the future. To this end, we will meet our responsibility as a social infrastructure provider by moving forward with initiatives focused on decarbonization—one of the most pressing issues the world faces today—and by leading the way for the marine transport industry and for Japan's private sector as a whole. As the MOL Group forges ahead with such initiatives, I hope our team can perform a useful role.

# Sustainability Initiatives

## I Sustainability Issues Overview

We have identified five Sustainability Issues (Materiality), which comprise the social issues our businesses should give priority to addressing. With the ongoing enhancement of Governance as a premise of business management, the Group will tackle the Sustainability Issues of Safety & Value and Environment while enabling reciprocal benefits among initiatives focused on Innovation and Human & Community. By advancing such initiatives, we will realize the MOL Group Vision, thereby enhancing corporate value and helping to build a sustainable society.

### Conceptual Diagram of Sustainability Issues

![img-49.jpeg](img-49.jpeg)

### Materiality Identification Process

In fiscal 2019, we initially identified Sustainability Issues (Materiality) by forming an internal team with cross-divisional membership, the Sustainability Promotion Project Team, which analyzed the negative and positive social impacts of our business activities and then categorized the impacts based on their relationships to social issues. In light of this analysis and categorization, we used two axes—impact on society and impact on the MOL Group's businesses—to condense these social issues into five Sustainability Issues.

### Sustainability Issues

#### Safety & Value

Provide added value through safe transportation and our social infrastructure business.

#### Environment

Conservation for marine and global environment.

#### Human & Community

Contributing to the growth and development of people and communities.

#### Innovation

Innovation for development in marine technology.

#### Governance

Governance and compliance to support businesses.

### Sustainability Issues Revision and MOL Sustainability Plan Formulation

In fiscal 2021, we revised our Sustainability Issues to reflect developments in relation to climate change, human rights issues, and other aspects of the social environment as well as changes in our business environment during the two years since we had first identified Sustainability Issues.

To accelerate initiatives focused on addressing the Sustainability Issues, we established targets, KPIs, and action plans for each issue and formulated the MOL Sustainability Plan in April 2022. We will steadily implement this plan, measure its effectiveness, and make improvements as appropriate.

![img-50.jpeg](img-50.jpeg)

### A Message from the Chief Environment and Sustainability Officer (CESO)

#### Purpose of the MOL Sustainability Plan

The worldwide trend toward decarbonization has become clearer since the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was held in fall 2021. In addition, society is increasingly focusing on biodiversity, human rights, and other matters as pressing issues. The MOL Group has advanced initiatives to achieve respective goals based on the Sustainability Issues (Materiality) identified in fiscal 2019, and the Group needs to accelerate these initiatives even further.

Meanwhile, as CESO I have taken great pains to instill the Sustainability Issues in all employees. I realized that, as the Sustainability Issues are highly abstract, employees grasped the concepts but additional steps were needed to encourage them to take ownership of the issues, incorporate them into daily work, and change behavior. Accordingly, the recently released MOL Sustainability Plan (MSP) makes the Sustainability Issues more concrete, understandable, and easy to put into practice for employees and a range of other stakeholders. In relation to each Sustainability Issue, the plan establishes clear KPIs and action plans. We have also included such design features as the creation of icons for each issue.

### Guided by the MSP, we will step up the pace of efforts to address our Sustainability Issues

![img-51.jpeg](img-51.jpeg)

### Toshiaki Tanaka

Representative Director, Executive Vice President Executive Officer
Chief Environment and Sustainability Officer (CESO)

In an organization like ours, where employees of various nationalities work in regions worldwide, setting out a clear road map is essential. For example, in the environmental field, the fiscal 2021 announcement of MOL Group Environmental Vision 2.1 ahead of the MSP has boosted the progress of concrete initiatives. We have begun a project tasked with introducing for contracts with U.S. customers dry bulkers that incorporate two environmental technologies: Wind Challenger hard sail system and Rotor Sail. We have also decided to introduce LNG-fueled car carriers. Moreover, the Group has seen the emergence of self-starting efforts to advance environmental strategies. The personnel of our London base have launched Green Circle, an interdepartmental team that is conducting such activities as gathering information from universities and research institutions and exploring involvement in measures aimed at making U.K. ports carbon neutral. As for non-environmental Sustainability Issues, I hope that the KPIs and action plans established when preparing the MSP will provide reference points for employees and encourage them to make positive changes in business activities.

### Integration of the MSP and Business Plans to Enhance Corporate Value

With our sights set on advancing the MSP in an even more effective manner, we are considering its integration with respective divisions' business plans in the new management plan scheduled for release in fiscal 2023. We believe that these integrated plans will enable employees to better understand the connections between their jobs and the Sustainability Issues while advancing business plans vigorously and achieving results. Unlike sales divisions, divisions involved in corporate services, such as human resources and technology, tend to be less able to see the connection between the work at hand and society due to the nature of their operations. I will do my utmost as the CESO to persuasively demonstrate the value of integrating the Sustainability Issues into operations, thereby instilling an understanding of our initiatives among all employees, regardless of their division.

In fiscal 2021, we revised the MOL Group Corporate Mission and the MOL Group Vision, while in fiscal 2022 we have formulated the MSP. In line with new commitments that have resulted, we will improve services and create new businesses while fulfilling social responsibilities. By pursuing this integrated approach to create a cycle of improvement and innovation and by communicating our efforts to society in a clear, readily understandable way, we will heighten both our brand value and corporate value.

## **Provide Added Value through Safe Transportation and Our Social Infrastructure Business**

MOL aims to promote sustainability and prosperity in people's everyday lives and in industries around the world, by transporting energy, commodities, and finished products safely, reliably, and cost-effectively.

#### Strengthen ICT-Enabled Support of Safe Operation

Established at the Head Office to monitor and support from shore the safe operation of vessels 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, the Safety Operation Supporting Center (SOSC) realizes its role by combining the expertise and experience of two on-duty personnel—one of whom is a captain—and information obtained from a range of systems and external sources. Based on advances in digital technologies and lessons learned from accidents, the SOSC is upgrading systems and increasing safety even further.

#### SPIRIT Vessel Movement Monitoring System

Introduced in January 2021, the SPIRIT (Sustainable Platform with Intellectual Resource and Innovative Technology) system enables us to monitor where our approximately 800 vessels are around the world and what kind of weather and sea conditions they are experiencing at any given time. Moreover, while tracking the movements of individual vessels, the system allows us to conduct multifaceted risk assessments by combining information on piracy, military exercises, and a range of other information. In April 2022, the functions of the system were upgraded even further so that it can incorporate the voyage plans of each vessel. The system is used not only by the SOSC but also by vessel operators and other related in-house personnel to provide support to vessels in operation.

#### Navigation Risk Monitoring System

Developed as a measure to prevent a recurrence of the WAKASHIO grounding accident, which occurred on July 25, 2020, our navigation risk monitoring system began full-scale operation at the end of January 2022. The system constantly monitors many different types of data, including data on vessel positions and water depths as well as information from the Electronic Chart Display and Information System. If vessels are about to enter waters where there is a high risk of grounding, the system alerts the SOSC, which continuously observes this system and, if necessary, initiates measures by telephoning captains directly to alert them.

#### 4 Message from the Chief Safety Officer

![img-56.jpeg](img-56.jpeg)

Mitsuhisa Tanimoto
Managing Executive Officer
Chief Safety Officer
Director General, Headquarters of Safety Operations

MDL is engaged in a wide range of businesses around the world. The Company operates approximately 800 vessels and offshore plants, and these vessels and plants are of many different types. In addition to established measures for the management of operating vessels' safety and the prevention of accident recurrence, we are further bolstering our ability to manage safety levels by backcasting from target profiles and implementing initiatives accordingly.

In ensuring safety and advancing our businesses going forward, personnel development is essential. To build reliable capabilities for safe operation, we will utilize not only the Japanese personnel who form the core of our marine technical divisions but also marine technical specialists from all over the world. Within the Headquarters of Safety Operations, we have established the Global Maritime Resources Division to lead our international policy on assignment of seafarers in various nations and the utilization of non-Japanese marine technical specialists. Moreover, we have appointed a non-Japanese marine technical specialist to serve as the general manager of the new division. We will continue developing as a corporate group in which diverse personnel play active roles.

Through our safety campaign and other initiatives, we are fostering a safety culture that is common to all Group personnel, regardless of their profession or job. In addition, we will promote safe operation through measures focused on both technologies and human factors. Specifically, we will utilize information and communications technology (ICT) and DX to support vessels from shore and conduct training and drills for crew members.

As chief safety officer, I am committed to raising the safety levels of the MDL Group even higher while helping to improve the safety of marine transport through collaborative initiatives that involve industry peers and related organizations.

#### Creation of New Added Value

#### Marine Renewable Energy Business Initiatives

Foraying into all offshore power generation-related business fields, including transport, power generation, and peripheral businesses

Marine renewable energy comprises five types of power generation: offshore wind, wave power, tidal power, ocean current, and ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC). By utilizing the inexhaustible supply of seawater and waves as an energy source, the realization of power supplies that are stable and particularly resilient to stormy weather is possible. We are involved in offshore wind, wave power, tidal power, and OTEC power generation.

#### Wave Power Generation

In 2020, we began participating in the management of Bombora Wave Power Pty Ltd, a British developer and manufacturer of wave power generation equipment. Bombora Wave Power is pursuing the early commercialization and widespread use of this type of power generation through the development of generation that uses the company's mWave™ membrane-type wave energy converter. Moreover, the company is developing the InSPIRE™ floating platform, which integrates mWave™ with floating wind turbines. Demonstration tests of a full-size 1.5 MW mWave™ converter are scheduled to begin off the coast of Pembroke, Wales, in the second half of 2022. Meanwhile, the company plans to conduct demonstration tests of a large-scale InSPIRE™ platform around 2025.

As a Bombora Wave Power shareholder, the MDL Group will help the company to advance its business. We will also provide the company with such practical support as assistance with the selection of suitable sites and finding local partners in Japan and Mauritius. When the company's wave power generation becomes commercially viable, we will establish synergistic relationships between it and our projects related to the offshore wind power generation business.

![img-57.jpeg](img-57.jpeg)

A rendering of the InSPIRE™ concept whereby mWave™ wave energy converters are integrated with the bases of floating wind turbines.

\*1 Pressure fluctuations below the water surface mean rubber membranes in a pumping motion, creating flows of air within the energy conversion system that are used to generate power. The system is installed on the seafarers of coastal waters that are between eight and 28 meters deep. The system can operate 24 hours a day and is not easily affected by weather conditions as it is installed below the water surface.

#### Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC)

OTEC uses temperature differences of around 20°C between surface water and water at depths of between 750 meters and 1,000 meters to evaporate ammonia and other media with low boiling points. The resulting steam turns the turbines of generators, producing electricity. The principle was first proposed in France in 1881, and the development of OTEC has been underway since the 1970s. Waters with high surface temperatures, such as those in the vicinity of Okinawa in Japan and equatorial regions, are suitable for OTEC. Due to the growing expectations for renewable energy in recent years, development activities have been gathering momentum in Japan, the United States, France, and other countries. Since April 2022, we have been collaborating with our partners Saga University and Xenesys Inc. to participate in the operation of a 100 kW-class OTEC demonstration facility in Kumajima, Okinawa. Owned by Okinawa Prefecture, the facility was established in 2013. We are advancing efforts with a new to introducing the world's first 1 MW-class OTEC facility to Okinawa around 2025. We also aim to realize a floating OTEC facility in the future.

#### Initiatives in Mauritius

The government of Mauritius aims to meet 60.0% of the country's energy needs through renewables by 2030 and has officially recognized wave power generation as a future power source. Also, past studies have confirmed that conditions in the country are highly compatible with the introduction of OTEC. With the cooperation of Japan's government, the MDL Group is verifying suitable sites for wave power generation in the coastal areas of Mauritius. We are also analyzing the introduction of OTEC to the country. By introducing to Mauritius the Kumajima model, which utilizes deep ocean water from the seas near Kumajima in Okinawa Prefecture, we will not only establish a power generation business but also contribute to the creation and development of a wide range of industries.

\*2 In this model, deep ocean water is actively used for secondary purposes, often being used for power generation, the water is of sufficiently low temperature for use in an conditioning and industrial applications. In addition, the nutrients in the water can be utilized for aquaculture, agriculture, and the manufacture of beauty products. In Mauritius, the water is expected to be used as coolant for data centers and the air-conditioning of accommodation facilities.

### Endorsement of TCFD Recommendations and Conduct of Scenario Analysis

MOL conducts scenario analysis using the TCFD framework to identify risks and opportunities that may arise from climate change. With reference to the new TCFD guidance released in October 2021, we are further enhancing analysis and significantly increasing disclosure. For example, in fiscal 2022 we added 1.5°C scenarios to the range of scenarios that we use for analysis, which includes well-below 2.0°C scenarios, among others.

Please visit our website for details on our disclosure in line with TCFD recommendations.

### Governance

To advance initiatives for the Group's environmental strategies and sustainability issues in a manner that is integrated with management plans, MOL has established the Environment & Sustainability Committee as a subordinate committee of the Executive Committee. The former committee deliberates and determines basic policies on climate change-related matters. Following its deliberations, particularly important matters are reported to the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors for discussion and approval.

### Formulation of Environment and Sustainability Policies and the Supervision of Their Implementation

![img-95.jpeg](img-95.jpeg)

### Strategy

We conduct scenario analysis-based assessments of climate change impacts to identify the long-term risks and opportunities associated with climate change, understand the impacts on our businesses, and incorporate appropriate measures into our management plans. In addition to the existing well-below 2.0°C scenario and the 2.6°C scenario, we conducted analysis using a 1.5°C scenario in fiscal 2022. Using 2050 as a target year, we assessed the quantitative financial impact of each risk and opportunity. At the same time, we verified that in all scenarios the transition plan set out in MOL Group Environmental Vision 2.1 will function appropriately as a mitigation measure and realize sufficient resilience.

### Particularly Significant Risks and Opportunities Identified through Scenario Analysis

![img-96.jpeg](img-96.jpeg)

### Risk Management

By classifying major risks related to our overall businesses and mapping these risks based on their impact level and likelihood of occurrence, we are preparing to identify important issues. Identified as a major risk through this process, climate change is being further classified and assessed by the Environment & Sustainability Committee (4pages 72 to 77).

### Indicators and Targets

MOL conducts management based on a variety of indicators and targets. For example, we disclose emissions intensity and Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions, and we have incorporated these indicators into the medium- and long-term targets set out in MOL Group Environmental Vision 2.1. Also, we set quantitative targets in management plans for investments in low-carbon and decarbonization fields and conduct related performance management. Further, our decisions on investments reflect carbon prices that are calculated by using internal carbon pricing.

### Preservation of Marine Environments and Protection of Biodiversity

#### Ballast Water Management

Carried out when loading cargo, the discharge of ballast water by vessels can negatively impact marine ecosystems by transferring foreign marine organisms across borders. Before the 2017 enforcement of the Ballast Water Management Convention, in 2014 the MOL Group established and began implementing a Groupwide policy of equipping vessels with ballast water treatment systems. As of June 2022, we have equipped 233 existing vessels and vessels under construction with these systems.

#### Management of Hull Biofouling

To prevent the adverse effect on biodiversity resulting from the transborder movement of marine organisms attached to hulls (hull biofouling), the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has adopted various regulatory guidelines, which are currently being revised. Our involvement in the revision of international guidelines on hull biofouling entails offering our opinions as a business operator through industry associations.

#### Prevention of Marine Pollution

An international convention requires that vessel fuel tanks and tankers have double hulls, and the MOL Group complies with all related conventions and laws.

Based on the MARPOL Convention, we prepare onboard waste management plans requiring the separation, collection, storage, and disposal of onboard waste. Further, designated managers ensure all crew members are thoroughly apprised of these plans. We also appropriately dispose of onboard waste oil and water.

### CASE 1: Participating in the Ocean180 Marine Biodiversity Big Data Project

MOL participates in Ocean180, an industry-academia-government project led by Professor Yasuhiro Kubota of the University of the Ryukyus and tasked with protecting marine biodiversity. To this end, the long-term project is using big data on marine life, statistical modeling, and artificial intelligence to render ocean ecosystems visible. The project's name reflects a commitment to turning around the ongoing deterioration in marine biodiversity. The MOL Group contributes to the project by providing the operational data from its vessels. At the same time, we are using the information and knowledge gained from this project in other initiatives aimed at protecting marine biodiversity.

### CASE 2: Collecting and Investigating Marine Microplastic and Debris

As of 2022, five of our owned vessels have installed a device jointly developed by MOL and Mura Co., Ltd. for collecting microplastic, which refers to plastic grains measuring 5 mm or less. In Southeast Asia, where the problem of marine debris is becoming increasingly severe, we are conducting an investigation with the aim of establishing and introducing a marine debris collection system that suits local conditions and uses a specialized vessel to collect marine debris. Also, in the 2019-2020 Japan-Palau Goodwill Yacht Race, we cooperated with the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology in an ocean plastics observation project.

### 3.3 Prevention of Air Pollution

#### SOx emissions countermeasures

- Utilizing compliant fuel with sulfur content of ± 0.50%
- Equipping vessels with SOx scrubbers
- Switching to alternative fuels

#### NOs emissions countermeasures

- Installing onboard SCR (selective catalytic reduction) systems
- Installing onboard EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) systems

### 3.4 Environmental Management

Since 2001, we have been developing and operating our own environmental management system, and the system has obtained certification under the ISO 14001 international standard. We will steadily reinforce and improve the operation of this system in line with our Environmental Strategy, which is one of the three pillars of our management plan.

## Contributing to the Growth and Development of People and Communities

MOL aims to achieve successful coexistence among everyone involved in the MOL group businesses and the sustainable growth and development of communities through its activities as a single entity, while that respects diverse personalities and that can maximize the capabilities of every employee.

In April 2021, we established the Diversity & Inclusion Management Basic Policy, which identifies the advancement of diversity & inclusion as a new driver of growth. With this policy forming the core of its human resource strategy, the MOL Group will build frameworks for combining the diverse talents and attributes of Group employees around the world and thereby enabling the creation of new value.

### Empowerment of Women

The empowerment of female employees is essential in promoting diversity & inclusion. As a company that excels at promoting women in the workplace, we earned selection as a "Nadeshiko Brand" company in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021. As well as existing support that helps employees meet work and childcare responsibilities, we will raise the percentage of women in managerial positions by empowering women in line with an action plan based on the Act on Promotion of Women's Participation and Advancement in the Workplace. As part of these efforts, an International Women's Day we will partner with other companies to hold joint events focused on career development and self-development.

### Mid-Career Hires

Since 2001, we have been conducting mid-career hiring to attract and develop a diverse workforce. As a result, about a quarter of our land-based employees in career-track and managerial positions are mid-career hires. By welcoming into our workforce people with many different types of individuality and attributes—such as experience, personal qualities, skills, and values—we are achieving diversity & inclusion.

### Employment of People with Disabilities

With a diverse workforce as a premise, the MOL Group is creating workplace environments that enable all employees to utilize their abilities and fostering an organizational culture that encourages mutual understanding among the various individuals in the Group. In accordance with these efforts, since April 2021 we have been employing people with disabilities through the MOL RAISE in-house farm program, which operates in Kashigaya in Saitama Prefecture. By enabling Head Office employees and officers to visit the farm and participate in cultivation and harvesting and by using the farm's fresh vegetables as ingredients at the Head Office cafeteria, we encourage a wide range of employees and officers to think about those different from themselves, helping create an organization based on respect for diversity.

### Health and Productivity Management

In April 2021, we formulated the Declaration on Health and Productivity Management. Viewing the enhancement of employee health as an important management task, we are further developing initiatives aimed at the Groupwide dissemination and promotion of the values set out in the declaration. Since becoming the first shipping company selected as a Health & Productivity Stock by the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, we have earned this recognition for a second consecutive year.

The Human Resources Division plays a central role in providing tailored support and encouragement to employees in coordination with MOL's health insurance association and with a team of industrial health personnel consisting of industrial doctors, internal medicine doctors, psychiatrists, certified psychologists, health nurses, and massage therapists. Through training and various other measures, we are raising employees' awareness of health management. Also, we are rigorously ensuring that employees receive regular health checks and increasing the percentage of employees that receive stress checks to prevent mental health disorders. Other initiatives include a smoking cessation support program, which is reducing the percentage of employees who smoke.

### 23 Health and Productivity Management

In addition to conventional marine transport, the MOL Group is developing various social infrastructure businesses and taking on new challenges to meet society's changing needs with respect to such issues as environmental protection. In all of these businesses, personnel are the driving force of initiatives. As the Chief Human Resource Officer, I would like to contribute to the initiatives of each business.

Given that securing and developing diverse human resources is an urgent issue for the Group, which aims to achieve global growth by leveraging its comprehensive capabilities, we will create an environment that enables individuals to demonstrate their talents and play active roles.

### Stakeholder Engagement

Recognizing that our important stakeholders include shareholders and investors, customers, business partners, employees, government agencies, local communities, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), we engage in the various forms of stakeholder dialogue shown in the table below. By utilizing the valuable opinions obtained through these dialogues in management, we will advance business activities in line with the needs of society and help address a range of social issues.

### 23 Advancement of Local Communities

The MOL Group has engaged in restoration and preservation of the natural environment and contribution to local communities in Mauritius since an oil spill resulting from the running aground of chartered vessels the WAKASHIO in 2020.

We established the MOL Charitable Trust in June 2021 and the MOL Mauritius International Fund for Natural Environment Recovery and Sustainability in November 2021. The trust and fund are in the process of steadily disbursing a total of approximately 9800.0 million. In December 2021, 26 projects were selected to receive grants from the trust, while in May 2022 it was decided to provide grants to 11 projects from the fund.

Through the trust and fund, we will provide long-term support focused on the restoration and conservation of the rich natural environment and ecosystems of Mauritius, including mangrove forests and coral reefs; protection and research activities for wild birds and migratory birds, including indigenous species; the development of fisheries, tourism, and cultural activities, which form the foundations of the Mauritian economy; and the training of local personnel to support all of these activities. Also, we aim to contribute to the sustainable economic development of the country. To this end, we are conducting feasibility studies on the introduction of such marine renewable energy as wave power generation and ocean thermal energy conversion generation.

In March 2021, MOL began participating in the liquefied CO₂ ocean transport business by investing in Norway's Larvik Shipping AS, which has managed industrial liquefied CO₂ carriers in Europe for more than 30 years. Further, with our sights set on future growth in transport demand, we are developing specialized carriers. Envisioning a range of transport needs, we completed a concept study on multiple vessel types with Mitsubishi Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. in November 2021.

Liquefied CO₂ carriers will play an important role in the carbon capture, utilization, and storage value chain, attracting attention as a means of realizing a low-carbon or carbon-free society. For MOL, demand for the transport of liquefied CO₂ has the potential to replace demand for the transport of fossil energy resources, which is expected to gradually decline. Although issues remain to be resolved before liquefied CO₂ carriers can be commercialized, we will continue utilizing a wide range of internal and external expertise to advance development initiatives.

### Wind Hunter Project

Following on from the Wind Challenger Project I-9page 56), which is developing a hard sail that enables wind-power propulsion, since November 2020 we have been working on the Wind Hunter Project to achieve zero emissions through the use of wind power, hydrogen, and fuel cells. In November 2021, we successfully completed stage one sea trials using the yacht WINZ MARU equipped with a small power generation plant in Omura Bay, Nagasaki Prefecture. At sea, a cycle was completed in the following order: ocean wind-based power generation, hydrogen production, hydrogen storage, use of the stored hydrogen for fuel cell power generation, and propulsion by an electric propeller. In stage two, we will build a 60-meter-long sailing vessel by 2036. Stage three will entail developing and building a large zero-emissions carrier by 2030.

### Groupwide Adoption of Clean Energy

#### N initiatives for Ammonia-Fueled Vessels

We are developing technologies related to ammonia fuel, a promising next-generation clean alternative to LNG fuel. Although ammonia-fueled marine engines have yet to be commercialized, we have launched a pilot project by concluding a memorandum of understanding with MAN Energy Solutions and Mitsui E&S Machinery, Ltd., with a view to ordering vessel main engines that are primarily fueled by ammonia.

Further, aiming to build an ammonia-fueled oceangoing ammonia carrier, we have begun joint development with Toureiro's Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. and Mitsui E&S Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. The envisioned vessel is a mid-size ammonia carrier that achieves net zero CO₂ emissions while underway by using some of its ammonia cargo as fuel. Moreover, the project is tasked with designing a highly versatile vessel that can call at the major ammonia loading and receiving ports and be deployed on a wide variety of routes. We will proceed with joint development aimed at the completion and service commencement of an inaugural commercial net zero GHG emissions oceangoing vessel around 2026, thereby progressing toward one of the targets set out in MOL Group Environmental Vision 2.1.

#### Development of Liquefied CO₂ Carriers

In March 2021, MOL began participating in the liquefied CO₂ ocean transport business by investing in Norway's Larvik Shipping AS, which has managed industrial liquefied CO₂ carriers in Europe for more than 30 years. Further, with our sights set on future growth in transport demand, we are developing specialized carriers.

### Increasing the Energy Efficiency of Vessels

#### Wind Power Utilization

MOL is engaged in a range of initiatives aimed at exploiting the power of wind, an important energy-saving solution. One such initiative is the Wind Challenger Project, which is tasked with reducing the fossil fuel consumption and environmental impact of large commercial vessels by converting wind power into propulsion through the use of a hard sail. A single hard sail is estimated to reduce GHG emissions by roughly 5.0% on routes between Japan and Australia and 8.0% on routes between Japan and the West Coast of North America. We aim to achieve even greater benefits by installing multiple hard sails and using them in combination with other GHG emission reduction measures. A new coal carrier—which will become the first vessel equipped with the hard sail—is currently in the final stages of construction and is scheduled for completion in October 2022. Further, we have concluded a contract for the construction of a second hard sail equipped vessel, which is for Enviro Partners, LP, a major global company in the wood biomass energy field.

We will become a leading company in the use of wind power by introducing technologies optimally suited to particular vessel sizes, cargoes, and routes. In addition to the Wind Challenger hard sail, we will introduce a cylindrical Rotor Sail, which utilizes the Magnus effect for propulsion, and a delta sail, which is mounted on cargo handling cranes.

#### ICT Utilization for Safe, Efficient Operation

#### Use of Digital Twin Technology

The rapid development of big data, the Internet of Things (IoT), and other ICT is increasing the possibilities for using ICT at sea and between vessels and land. Our core initiative for the exploitation of ICT is the FOCUS Project, which was launched in fiscal 2018. We utilize detailed voyage and engine data on operation in actual seas, which is collected from approximately 10,000 sensors installed in each vessel. Roughly 180 operating vessels were equipped with sensors as of the end of March 2022. After being stored on a cloud computing data platform, the data is utilized for advanced operational monitoring as well as the analysis of propulsive performance.

As part of the FOCUS Project, we are taking advantage of digital twin technology, which digitally reproduces real-world events in real time. In a virtual space, a copy of reality is constructed on a digital system, and various simulations are then performed. The analysis of simulation results enables us to optimize real-world actions. The MOL Group is advancing development initiatives under the themes shown in the table below.

|  **Hull Structure** | Based on the stress that has been placed on a hull since its completion, structural fatigue is precisely estimated, and hull maintenance work is optimized during periodic dusting.  |
| --- | --- |
|  **Mars Engine Operation** | With a high level of precision, engines' operating conditions and degree of deterioration over time are estimated and engine characteristics are analyzed through the visualization of mass and energy consumption. The mass and energy consumption are assessed using navigation. The results are used to present engine overload (torque roll) and curb torque fluctuations during operation in stormy weather, thereby facilitating optimal, safe operation.  |
|  **Route Recommendation** | Based on the analysis of a vessel's propulsion performance in actual seas and weather and sea forecast information, the optimal route and propulsion output for reducing GHG emissions while ensuring safety and punctuality are selected and recommended.  |

![img-131.jpeg](img-131.jpeg)

#### Autonomous Vessel Navigation

With the aims of enhancing safety levels and lightening the workloads of crew members, the MOL Group is working on the development and introduction of technologies for autonomous vessel navigation. Given that about 80% of navigation accidents are attributable to human error, we will reduce the risk of accidents by using technologies for autonomous vessel navigation to perform tasks currently performed by crews.

In fiscal 2021, MOL participated in the MEOURI 20x0, a project led by the Nippon Foundation that is focused on the unmanned operation of vessels. Under the project, a consortium of six companies conducted successful sea trials of the unmanned operation of the coastal car ferry Sunflower Shiretoko on the approximately 400-nautical-mile route between Tomakomai Port in Hokkaido and Darai Port in Ibaraki Prefecture and of the coastal containership Mikage on the approximately 145-nautical-mile route between Tsuruya Port in Fukui Prefecture and Sakai Port in Tottori Prefecture. The ferry is owned and operated by MOL Ferry Co., Ltd., while the containership is owned by Imoto Ship Company and operated by Imoto Lines, Ltd. In the aforementioned sea trials, an autonomous vessel operation control system, developed by Mitsui E&S Shipbuilding, realized autonomous vessel navigation by referring to accurate analysis of vessel location information, wind, tides, currents, and various other external factors; vessel-specific attributes such as maneuverability, acceleration and deceleration performance, and equipment configuration; and rules applied to vessels. If there were other ships, obstacles, or debris on the set routes, the vessels safely navigated along avoidance routes based on information gathered and provided by a vessel peripheral information integration system developed by Furuno Electric Co., Ltd. Borthing and unberthing, which require especially delicate handling, were realized by enabling the autonomous vessel operation control system to use information from borthing and unberthing support sensors developed by Furuno Electric. When mooring a vessel in port, an onboard crew member normally passes a heaving line to a worker on the pier by throwing the line. In these sea trials, however, an automatic flight drone, which was developed by A.L.I. Technologies Inc., was used to carry the line to piers.

In addition to participating in the initiatives of the aforementioned consortium, the MOL Group is developing elemental technologies with the aim of realizing automated watch-keeping and the automated creation of routes that avoid collisions with other vessels. We will continue devising and introducing technologies to heighten safety levels and reduce the workload of crews.

**One Mile Ahead**

In April 2022, we established a new slogan for technology development: One Mile Ahead. This slogan continues the themes of the Sengaku ISHIN Project and ISHIN NEXT-MOL SMART SHIP PROJECT, which were launched in 2009 and 2016, respectively, as symbols of technological innovation aimed at advancing the safety and environment-friendliness of vessel operations. The new slogan for technology development expresses our determination to steadily move forward "one mile" at a time in the way that a vessel voyaging in stormy weather heads toward its destination no matter how rough the seas. Further, the slogan represents our commitment as an industry-leading corporate group to always pursue technologies that are "one mile" ahead.

Announced in June 2021, MOL Group Environmental Vision 2.1 calls on us to achieve net zero GHG emissions for the entire Group by 2050. The advancement of our strategies, which involve numerous technological innovations, is a mission we must fulfill to help address the environmental issues that the world is facing. Given the major changes that the entire logistics industry is undergoing as Oil progresses, technical personnel will play integral roles in technology development and innovation initiatives. At the core of such initiatives is the Headquarters of Technology Innovations, which comprises the Technical Division, the Offshore Technical Division, and the Smart Shipping Division. As well as being assigned roles in these divisions and related sales divisions, our technical personnel are responsible for supervision and vessel management in relation to the shipbuilding projects of Group companies. Currently, we have 80 technical personnel in Japan and 16 technical personnel assigned to overseas bases.

Going forward, the Headquarters of Technology Innovations will concentrate on three goals:

- Resolving various issues in the marine transport industry by using leading-edge ICT
- Reducing environmental impact by lowering GHG emissions through the utilization of wind power as a renewable energy and the introduction of clean alternative fuels
- Benefiting society as a whole not only through vessels but also by promoting marine environmental conservation, FSRUs, offshore wind power generation-related businesses, and liquefied CO2 marine transport.

In addition to augmenting our technical teams in Japan and overseas, we will strengthen partnerships with external organizations. Under our new slogan for technology development, we will make a concerted drive toward our target profile, focusing efforts on the development of unique technologies that leverage both hardware in the form of elemental technologies and software in the form of IT.

# Aiming to Enhance Corporate Value through Tireless Improvement of Governance

![img-134.jpeg](img-134.jpeg)

**Junichiro Ikeda**
Governance Director
Chairman Executive Officer

Over the past few years, the MDL Group has accelerated governance reforms through such measures as revising the director remuneration plan and the formulation of succession plans. What have these reforms achieved? What are the remaining issues? How should governance evolve to reflect the Group's ongoing advance into a different growth phase? To address such questions, a dialogue was held between Junichiro Ikeda, MDL's representative director and chairman executive officer, and Etsuko Katsu, one of the Company's outside directors.

(The dialogue was held in April 2021.)

## Governance Improvement through the Active Involvement of Outside Directors

**Ikeda:** We have been focusing on governance reform over the past few years. Also, recent structural reforms of the containership business and various other businesses have reached favorable trajectories, and the Company as a whole is in very good shape. Moreover, I feel that governance reform has supported these structural reforms. Going forward, as we continue transforming ourselves into a social infrastructure group centered on marine transport, I believe that we should further evolve governance in a manner corresponding to this transformation.

As well as the sincere opinions received from outside directors and outside Audit & Supervisory Board members in various forums, there are external expectations in this regard, such as those stemming from revisions to Japan's Corporate Governance Code. I recognize that proactively responding to these expectations remains extremely important.

**Katsu:** Looking back on the years since I assumed the position of outside director, I believe that MDL has made great strides in governance. From the outset, I felt that both board members and MDL itself were determined to advance reforms. Particularly in the past few years, tangible results have been emerging, mainly with respect to the Board of Directors' greater effectiveness. Through the discussions of the Nomination Advisory Committee and the Remuneration Advisory Committee, we have achieved significant results, such as the formulation of a CEO succession plan and the revision of the director remuneration plan. In addition, various efforts have freed up time to discuss management issues from a long-term perspective. So, I feel that the Board is increasingly becoming a body that is focused on performing a supervisory role and examining and determining strategies. Coupled with the changes in the Tokyo Stock Exchange market system and the creation of the Prime Market in April 2022, I believe that in-house awareness of the need to take the initiative in advancing reform is stronger than ever.

**Ikeda:** As an example of how the opinions of outside directors have dictated the direction of the Group, our discussions when formulating MDL Group Environmental Vision 2.1, which was announced by the Company in 2021, left a particularly strong impression on me. The vision calls on us to achieve net zero GHG emissions for the entire Group by 2050. The goal initially proposed by executive officers was less ambitious. However, the unequivocal statements of an outside director to the effect that the proposed goal was inappropriate for the current era and that we must be more committed marked a turning point in discussions. In the end, the decision reached was that MDL, ahead of industry peers, would aim to achieve net zero GHG emissions for the entire Group by 2050.

Realization of this goal will require hardware that does not yet exist, including technologies and supply infrastructure for alternative fuels. Such feasibility issues inevitably made executive officers hesitant. Nonetheless, with the support of objective, big-picture viewpoints from outside the Company that looked ahead to the profile MDL should be pursuing, we were able to reach a momentous decision. Similarly, when we were formulating succession plans and revising the director remuneration plan, recommendations from outside directors led to more substantive, highly transparent decisions that included detailed provisions.

**Katsu:** As you mentioned, the role of an outside director is to present independent opinions incorporating the viewpoints of investors and shareholders, have them reflected in business management, and appropriately present the results to the outside world. Further, ensuring engagement with society is extremely important. In particular, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues are areas that outside directors are becoming increasingly conscious of. In the process of formulating MDL Group Environmental Vision 2.1, the MDL Sustainability Plan, and Rolling Plan 2022, various opinions were put forward. By having Executive Committee members take these opinions into consideration, I believe that we were able to present the vision and plans to society in a more favorable light.

**Ikeda:** All Board meetings, outside directors made recommendations that helped strengthen governance, but time constraints prevented extensive discussions. Therefore, in fiscal 2021 we established and began the operations of a new body called the Corporate Governance Council, which focuses exclusively on matters related to strengthening governance. As the council has only been in existence for a year, we are still finding our way to some extent. However, we have been using the council to elicit frank opinions from council members, categorize issues, seek proposals from Executive Committee members, depending on the type of issues identified, and request that the Nomination Advisory Committee and the Remuneration Advisory Committee hold further discussions on certain issues.

**Ikeda:** As the number of topics requiring discussion at Board meetings increased, I also felt that the time available for discussing governance was becoming limited in Board meetings. In addition, I think holding discussions at a venue separate from Board meetings is conducive to the creation of an atmosphere in which opinions can be exchanged among both internal and outside directors more freely than before. Further, we have designed the administration of the council so that it functions practically, rather than just being a venue for exchanges of opinions.

A company's overall target profile for corporate governance represents, in a sense, the corporate profile to which the entity should aspire. The Nomination Advisory Committee and the Remuneration Advisory Committee have consistently engaged in substantive discussions on their respective fields, but the Corporate Governance Council encompasses all governance-related themes, including topics discussed by these committees and the Board as well as topics related to auditing and internal control. I believe that the facilitation of systematic discussions on MDL's governance through the establishment of the council was a major achievement of fiscal 2021. The council also had fruitful discussions on such governance-related topics as cross-shareholdings, how outside directors should engage in dialogue with investors, and the training of directors.

We will further evolve governance to support MOL's major transition from a marine transport company to a social infrastructure group.

## Reasons for and Aims of the Revisions of the Skills Matrix and the Director Remuneration Plan

**SGS2** The composition of the Board is one of the fundamental elements of governance. The Company has recently revised its skills matrix for directors. The Nomination Advisory Committee and the Corporate Governance Council were able to hold thorough discussions regarding the type of expertise that is lacking in the current Board and, with an eye on the Company's target profile, the type of expertise the Board should possess. Moreover, I believe that these initiatives were extremely effective in enhancing the transparency of MOL from an external viewpoint.

**SGS3** In revising the skills matrix for directors recently, we advanced our approach by clearly separating and discussing experience and knowledge universally required in corporate management and experience and knowledge required in the management of a company that provides marine transport, which is a highly specialized industry. The previous skills matrix for directors did not differentiate clearly between these two types of experience and knowledge. As a result, we were able to renew our common understanding of the types of experience and knowledge that are truly needed by the senior management team of MOL as a social infrastructure group centered on marine transport.

We also deepened discussions on the types of knowledge that the Board should acquire going forward. Experience and knowledge are notably lacking in relation to technologies, including IT and DE skills.

**SGS4** Looking at the examples provided by other companies, some have chief digital officers on their boards of directors. Technologies and data analysis will be indispensable for the evolution of the Company's customer services. Also, having a Board that comprises members with different attributes and fields of activity is very good in the sense that discussions cover a range of opinions.

Of course, simply preparing a skills matrix is not the aim. Forming a Board that contributes to the sustainable growth of MOL is the key goal. For this reason, skills matrices and succession plans overlap to a large degree. Currently, the Company has a succession plan for the CEO, but there are no clear succession plans for members of the Board and outside directors. Therefore, the Nomination Advisory Committee should discuss an officer appointment system that is linked to the skills matrix.

**SGS5** You mentioned the need for succession plans for Board members. As well as utilizing the skills matrix in the appointment of Board members beginning from fiscal 2023 onward, we will cohesively manage succession plans in conjunction with a range of measures, including the training of existing directors and the development of future management personnel.

**SGS6** As succession plans are managed in such a way, I hope that the diversification of directors will also progress in terms of nationality, gender, age, and experience. In particular, the fundamental ideas about corporate management of non-Japanese executives are varied, and I think being exposed to opinions based on overseas perspectives will lead to new ideas.

Moving on to the revision of the director remuneration plan in fiscal 2021, the incorporation into the evaluation system of highly transparent financial indicators for single fiscal year performance-based remuneration and long-term target contribution-based remuneration was a major achievement. On the other hand, we spent considerable time discussing how to incorporate ESG indicators into the director remuneration plan in fiscal 2021, but this issue has been left unresolved. I hope that the Remuneration Advisory Committee will continue to discuss the issue in fiscal 2022.

**SGS7** When we were discussing revision of the director remuneration plan, initially some suggested that we should incorporate ESG indicators. In fact, we included safety indicators in the director remuneration plan ahead of time. Meanwhile, an essential concept underpinning the director remuneration plan is that the adopted indicators must be closely linked to MOL's business performance and the sustained enhancement of corporate value. I think just formally including indicators does not mean anything. While managing the MOL Sustainability Plan, announced in April 2022, I would like to spend a little more time assessing which type of indicators are appropriate.

**SGS8** With respect to both the skills matrix and the director remuneration plan, reaching decisions does not mean that the matters are closed. I think the key is to constantly monitor systems as the times and the Company should flexibly analyze the systems and explore various possibilities.

## Creation of a Board of Directors That Functions Even More Favorably

**SGS9** At the beginning of our conversation, I mentioned the importance of further evolving governance as the Company enters a new phase of growth. One of the issues related to this evolution is the position and role of the Board in the Company. To give one specific example, due to its institutional design, MOL has a Board that has for some time played a major role in execution. Consequently, the Board spends considerable time deliberating decisions on individual projects. On the other hand, I believe that we should strengthen the Board's primary roles, such as discussing the formulation of medium- to long-term strategies, the monitoring of investment progress, and Companywide risk management.

To secure time for such discussions and enhance the Board's effectiveness, we have been conducting Deliberation on Corporate Strategy and Vision (i.e., page 69) and transferring authority to the Executive Committee and below. However, I feel that these measures are reaching the limit of their usefulness. Although this is not an issue on which we can reach a conclusion immediately, we plan to proceed with discussions at the Corporate Governance Council including a review of institutional design.

**SGS10** I endorse this plan. The roles of MOL's Board are becoming increasingly focused on supervision and the examination and determination of strategy, and I think discussions on the type of governance that MOL should pursue, including optimal institutional design, will be extremely meaningful. I also strongly feel the need to further increase the opportunities for in-depth discussions on medium- to long-term strategies.

The recent changes in MOL and its business environment are one of the reasons why discussions on management strategies must be enhanced. Thanks to favorable business results in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021, the Group has accumulated a tremendous amount of cash. I believe that outside observers will be paying very close attention to how this cash is invested going forward and how the results of investments are monitored. In addition, environmental strategies are entering a critical phase. Given the numerous items that require analysis from a broad perspective—such as the outlook for global energy supply and demand, the wide range of alternative energy sources, and the reduction of CO2 emissions—I think furthering discussions on environmental strategies, with reference to expert opinions, is necessary.

**SGS11** Lastly, in enabling the Company to continue evolving its governance, I believe that my role as chairman of the Board is to manage it in ways that encourage lively discussions on long-term strategies. Further, I see my role as ensuring that the opinions expressed in these discussions are properly conveyed to Executive Committee members, that appropriate action is taken based on these opinions, and that feedback is provided to the Board on the results of these actions. To these ends, open communication between the Board and Executive Committee members is indispensable. Accordingly, I will actively play a bridging role between the two groups. I will also endeavor to improve the governance of the Company with reference to the recommendations you have provided today.

I feel that the Board of Directors is increasingly becoming a body that is focused on performing a supervisory role and examining and determining strategies.

## Corporate Governance

### Corporate Governance as the Foundation of Business Management

At the same time as being one of the MOL Group's five Sustainability Issues, corporate governance provides a foundation for the other four Sustainability Issues and for the implementation of Rolling Plan 2022. In recent years, the Company's business structure has become more complex. In addition to its simple, long-standing business model of transporting goods from one point to another, the Company has entered into such upstream and downstream areas as **F500s** and **F5RUs**. The Company is building a system that enables the Board of Directors, the Executive Committee, and other bodies and councils to fulfill required functions and roles, such as establishing Companywide strategies, identifying fields for new forays, determining resource allocation, screening individual investments and businesses, and managing and monitoring risk as well as ensuring that the initiatives implemented in relation to such matters help address the Sustainability Issues.

### Corporate Governance Structure

In addition to the audit functions performed by the Audit & Supervisory Board, which is independent from the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors comprises internal directors, who are also responsible for the execution of business operations, and outside directors, who specialize in supervisory functions. MOL realizes operations that are legally compliant, appropriate, and efficient by ensuring that the supervisory capabilities of the Board of Directors are effective.

In fiscal 2021, the Corporate Governance Council was established under the Board of Directors to serve as a forum for facilitating unrestricted discussion and incorporating outside knowledge with respect to overall issues related to the enhancement and strengthening of the corporate governance structure. The council is helping to improve the effectiveness of the Board of Directors by providing it with reports and recommendations. Further, the Company complies with all principles of Japan's Corporate Governance Code.

### Major Organizations

#### Board of Directors

As the central decision-making body of the Company, the Board of Directors deliberates and adopts resolutions on basic policies and the most important matters in relation to the business management of the MOL Group. The Board of Directors is focused on supervision and the analysis of strategy, with deliberation and decisions on individual issues delegated to the Executive Committee as much as possible. Specifically, one hour of each three-hour meeting of the Board of Directors is devoted to Deliberation on Corporate Strategy and Vision, in which one topic related to management strategy, the long-term vision, or general management is discussed, and internal directors, outside directors, and outside Audit & Supervisory Board members participate in a free exchange of opinions. (For details on the main agenda items discussed, please see page 69.) These exchanges of opinions are utilized in the formulation of each fiscal year's management plan. Moreover, since fiscal 2018 Board member discussion sessions have been held as required after meetings of the Board of Directors to provide an opportunity for early information sharing and discussion on important matters that have yet to reach the stage of being formally submitted as agenda items.

#### Audit & Supervisory Board

The Audit & Supervisory Board draws up audit plans and reports and shares the results of audits. All Audit & Supervisory Board members attend meetings of the Board of Directors, and full-time members also attend Executive Committee and other committee meetings to audit the deliberation and decision-making processes. By combining the information held by the full-time members with the high level of specialized expertise of the outside members, MOL has created a system that ensures the active exercise of authority from an objective standpoint.

#### Nomination Advisory Committee and Remuneration Advisory Committee

The Nomination Advisory and Remuneration Advisory committees have been voluntarily established as organizations under the Board of Directors. Nominating candidates for the position of director and formulating proposals on remuneration are fundamental corporate governance functions, and the establishment of these organizations is intended to facilitate in-depth deliberations by expert committees. Both committees are chaired by outside directors and are composed of three outside directors, the chairman, and the CEO. The Nomination Advisory Committee deliberates the election, appointment, and dismissal of directors and executive officers. From an objective standpoint, the Remuneration Advisory Committee examines director remuneration, including incentives for the long-term enhancement of corporate value.

#### Corporate Governance Council

With the aim of enhancing and strengthening the corporate governance structure, the Corporate Governance Council was established under the Board of Directors in fiscal 2021 to serve as a forum for facilitating specialized ongoing discussions on corporate governance that incorporate outside knowledge. Appointed by the Board of Directors, the council's members comprise three internal directors, all three outside directors, and all four Audit & Supervisory Board members. The council has a high degree of expertise and objectivity. In addition to being chaired by an outside director, the council is able to appoint outside experts and have them participate in deliberations.

#### Executive Committee and Committees under the Executive Committee

Within the scope of the basic policy approved by the Board of Directors, MOL transfers a significant amount of authority to conduct businesses to the Executive Committee. This helps to expedite decision-making on individual matters. Six committees exist under the Executive Committee to study and deliberate particularly important matters which are brought to the Executive Committee, as well as cross-divisional propositions.

#### Remuneration Advisory Committee (convened nine times)

**Chair of committee: Masaru Sinski (outside director)**

**Main Agenda Items:**
- Fiscal 2020 director denotes and hosts 2021 director remuneration.
- Revises of the remuneration plan for non-executive directors.
- Analysis of the peer group's mission through quotations of remuneration levels.
- Policy for decisions on such matters as the remuneration of individual directors and other matters.

#### Main Agenda Items Deliberated by the Corporate Governance Council

Convened four times in fiscal 2021:

**Chair of council: Etsuko Katsu (outside director)**
- Role of the Corporate Governance Council and selection of topics for deliberation.
- Identification of corporate governance issues in the MOL Group in light of revisions to Japan's Corporate Governance Code.
- Revision of internal rules to secure time for deliberations by the Board of Directors.
- Various issues (cross-identifiability and improvement of the skills of directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members) and other matters.

# Risk Management

## Overview of Risk Management

As a company engaged in a wide range of operations around the world, MDL is exposed to a variety of risks. In addition to overseeing a risk management system, the Board of Directors identifies new risks that need to be better managed and formulates risk-related policies through the Corporate Governance Council and through Deliberation on Corporate Strategy and Vision.

As shown in the table below, divisions are assigned to each individual risk, and pursuant with specific internal rules and regulations each risk is quantified and risk mitigation measures are taken, including the reduction of exposure through hedging and the transfer of risk through insurance. In normal times, relevant business divisions submit proposals and reports on individual measures to the Executive Committee and its subordinate committees, which enables an understanding of and decision-making in relation to risks throughout the Company. In the event of an emergency, the CEO serves as director general, establishes a response headquarters that comprises the core members of the Executive Committee as well as related executive officers and general managers, and ensures an appropriate and prompt response to the situation.

## Summary of Major Risks and Countermeasures

### Risks Associated with Operations

Centered on marine transport, MDL operates roughly 800 vessels and offshore plants, and these vessels and plants are of many different types. As a company that provides social infrastructure, some of the most serious risks we face are damage to ships and cargo or injury to crew members caused by vessel collisions, ships running aground, fires and other accidents, as well as environmental pollution from leakage of cargo oil and bunker oil (oil spills). To prevent accidents from occurring, without regard to owned vessels or chartered vessels, MDLs Headquarters of Safety Operations, sales divisions, shipowners (for chartered vessels), and ship management companies work closely together on tangible and intangible aspects of safety, from training and supervising crew members to adoption of safety standard specifications which effectively maintain the safety of our vessels. We also make a variety of preparations to counter the dangers of piracy and terrorism by providing sufficient training, putting in place precise operational rules, providing support from our Head Office, and installing necessary facilities.

Even in the event of an accident that could not be avoided despite our best efforts, involving damage to MDL or related parties, the Company is prepared with insurance policies that have the necessary amount of coverage (general liability insurance, hull and machinery insurance, war-risk insurance, loss of hire insurance) in order to secure adequate funds for any compensation and to avoid a major impact on the Company's business performance.

To mitigate reputational risk, MDL implements emergency response training once a year for major maritime accidents, responding to the media and disclosing information about the accident. Media consultants are hired when necessary.

### Shipping Market Fluctuation Risks, Customer Credit Risks, and Country Risks

Another fundamental risk on a par with accidents in the marine transport business is the risk of fluctuations in the shipping market. To prevent excessive market risks, we manage risks by (1) limiting the total amount of risks, (2) dispersing risks, and (3) reducing the amount of risks during each fiscal year.

To limit total risk exposure, we take steps to obtain medium- to long-term contracts with domestic and overseas customers that are highly creditworthy. In addition to narrowing down the portion of the fleet that is exposed to the market, we work to minimize risks by setting vessel charter periods from shipowners to coincide with periods of contracts with customers, thus neutralizing our exposure to market fluctuation. When investing in vessels not allocated under medium- to long-term agreements, we carefully monitor future vessel supply-demand balance and selectively execute such investments.

To disperse risk, we use portfolio management that develops a fleet comprising diverse types of vessels subject to different patterns of market fluctuation. This approach helps us to balance market risk across divisions, compensating for peaks and troughs.

Last, we reduce the amount of risks during each fiscal year by using freight forwarding agreements (FFAs) to hedge risk on vessel types such as Capsular bulkers and VLCCs. We secure stable profits by reducing market exposure during each fiscal year.

We manage our total amount of shipping market risks with a method we uniquely developed, called Asset Risk Control (i.e., page 27), to periodically measure and control risks so that it does not become excessive in comparison with shareholders' equity.

### 2 Measures to Upgrade Risk Management

MDL faces risks stemming from changes in the value of its assets, which are the source of the Company's business returns, due to fluctuations in the shipping market. With such risks in mind, in fiscal 2016 we introduced a framework for Total Risk Control, renamed Asset Risk Control in fiscal 2022. Under the framework, quantitative evaluations of risk are conducted by verifying the adequacy of shareholders' equity levels relative to the amount of value at risk (VaR). Moreover, the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee regularly review these evaluations. (For details, please see page 27 as well as "Shipping Market Fluctuation Risks, Customer Credit Risks, and Country Risks" on the opposite page.)

Further, we are continuing to upgrade administration systems for risks related to project and ship management, the business continuity plan (BCP), and compliance. Based on the experience of responding to an oil spill off Mauritius caused in August 2020 by the chartered vessel WAKASHIO, in 2021 we stipulated the establishment of a Headquarters of Crisis Control in the event of the actualization of a risk event that could significantly impact the business activities of the Group. In such a contingency, this headquarters will strive to ensure the continuity of the Group's businesses, maintain corporate value, and implement appropriate countermeasures based on due consideration for social impact. We have also launched an endeavor focused on establishing a risk assessment process for the periodic identification and evaluation of the risks faced by certain Group companies.

In addition, we aim to introduce a system that enables overall analysis of geopolitical risks and sustainability-related risks—both of which are becoming increasingly important due to changes in the external environment—and produces results that can be used in management decision-making. In 2022, the Board of Directors conducted deliberations focused on an overall assessment of risks and began exploring the establishment of Companywide risk mapping.

## Exchange Rate, Interest Rate, and Bunker Price Fluctuation Risks

## Exchange Rates

While the revenues of the Group's core sceangsing marine transport business are mostly in U.S. dollars, some costs and borrowings are on a Japanese yen basis, presenting an exchange rate risk. MOL strives to limit its exposure by dollarizing costs and borrowings. To reduce this risk further, we also flexibly employ foreign exchange hedging to limit profit sensitivity.

Interest Rates
The MOL Group is constantly investing capital to build new ships and replace existing ones. When securing long-term funding for capital investment, in principle we hedge interest rate risk by using fixed-rate loans or interest rate swaps.

## Climate Change Risks

By causing more severe weather and sea events, climate change such as global warming can present a danger to safe ship operations. The movement toward decarbonization to combat climate change has the potential to drastically change the business environment for MOL, which requires large volumes of bunker oil and transports various kinds of fossil energy as a main cargo, in the context of higher costs to comply with public regulations and a structural reduction in transport demand.

Under MOL Group Environmental Vision 2.1, which is in tune with these trends, MOL aims to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050. The Company has formulated and disclosed a road map for achieving this goal, and is now in the process of introducing clean alternative fuels and energir saving technologies while increasing the sophistication of efficient fleet operations. By developing and providing solu tions for alternative fuel transportation and low-carbon or decarbonization technology, MOL views this change as a business opportunity as decarbonization stimulates new demand. The MOL Group uses a TCFD framework to visualize its climate change risks and formulate related policies.

For details, please see "Conservation for Marine and Global Environment" on pages 66 to 69.

## Cybersecurity Risks

MOL aims to prevent security incidents by implementing the following measures to counter cybersecurity risks that have increased in recent years. In the event one occurs, we will take steps to minimize any adverse effects.

- Create organization dedicated to cybersecurity, and establish a response system for serious ICT incidents (strengthen collaboration across worldwide Group companies, including operating vessels)
- Standardizing internal regulations, security tools, IoT environment updates, and operations within the Group
- Assess Groupwide cyber risks and execute countermeasures
- Implement e-learning and targeted email training to improve security awareness and literacy of executives and employees
- To quickly gather information, coordinate with National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISCC), JPCERT, Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, Transportation ISAC Japan, and Nippon CSIRT Association
- Other: Build a cybersecurity management system (CSMS) for operating vessels that complies with international rules, strengthen network security with cloud security services, and assess and devise countermeasures for ransomware

Natural Disaster and Epidemic Risks
To keep vessels operating even in the event of major earthquakes or other natural disasters and to fulfill our social role of maintaining supply chains, we have formulated a BCP manual and introduced satellite offices and backup systems, and also provide ample training. We have completed the distribution of notebook PCs to all executives and employees and put remote working environments in place that use cloud-based tools. In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that started at the outset of 2020, in February 2020 MOL quickly launched a response headquarters led by an executive vice president. We implemented a range of mea sures to simultaneously ensure (1) securing the safety of related parties, and reducing the risk of spreading the infection, and (2) fulfilling MOL's mission to serve as social infra structure. We transitioned to full-time teleworking and rapidly identified any impacts on operating vessels and took necessary measures. As a result, we have successfully maintained business operations without any major disruptions, with the exception of challenges for crew member changes due to restrictions on travel between countries.

Compliance Risks
Compliance Initiatives
In 2014, the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) found that the MOL Group had violated Article 3 of the Japanese Antimonopoly Act in certain car carrier shipping trades. In response, the MOL Group has updated its compliance rules, which determine the scope and Rules of Conduct of its executives and employees, and provided ongoing training to ensure that the importance of compliance-is the major premise of all corporate activities-is etched deeply into the minds of all executives and employees, and make it the linchpin of decisions in daily business operations. The Compliance Committee convenes every three months to discuss compliance matters within the Group and respond to any violation incidents. Further, the number and details of compliance events are disclosed within the Company to raise awareness among all executives and employees.

Compliance Advisory Service Desks
The MOL Group has established internal and external compliance advisory service desks available in Japanese and English. These service desks can be used by officers, employees, and temporary staff of MOL and its Group companies. The external advisory service desk is entrusted to an outside attorney to run. The attorney transmits reports and consultations received to the Compliance Committee and continues to serve as a liaison between the Company and people submitting reports or seeking consultations. Both service desks keep
report and consultations strictly confidential and ensure that personnel, including those cooperating with an investigation, are not treated unfairly. We also welcome compliance-related inquiries through our website from external parties, including customers and suppliers both domestic and international.

## Initiatives to Comply with Antitrust Laws and Prevent

Corruption
The MOL Group takes rigorous measures to ensure compliance with the Antitrust Act and prevent corruption. We have an Antimonopoly Act Compliance Code and an Anti-Corruption (Anti-Bribery) Policy, as well as a Do's \& Don'ts Guide, which provides a set of more specific guidelines. We also implement a range of training sessions to keep all employees informed by providing them with overviews and points to note in relation to domestic and international laws and regulations.

With respect to corruption prevention, in fiscal 2022 we formulated a new Anti-Corruption Policy. As an addition to the Groupwide coverage of existing anti-bribery rules, the new policy calls on business partners involved in MOL's business activities to comply with the rules. Further, to reflect the growing expectations of society in recent years, we have prepared a version of the policy in English and posted the policy on our website. Moreover, the formulation of the policy is part of an action plan under the "anti-bribery" initiative focus of the "governance and compliance to support businesses" Sustainability Issue set out in the MOL Sustainability Plan.

#### **Risks Related to Human Rights and the Value Chain**

The MOL Group is stepping up measures related to respect for human rights and responsible procurement, which are initiative focuses set out under the "governance and compliance to support businesses" Sustainability Issue. In March 2022, we newly established the MOL Group Human Rights Policy and the MOL Group Supplier Procurement Guidelines and revised the existing MOL Group Basic Procurement Policy. Targeting internal and external stakeholders, these policies and guidelines underscore our commitment to human rights. Also, we are reaching out to business partners to seek their understanding of and cooperation with the policies and guidelines so that together we can build a sustainable value chain based on due consideration for human rights, safety, and the environment.

#### **Human Rights and Value Chain Policies and Guidelines**

![img-140.jpeg](img-140.jpeg)

#### **Value Chain Management**

Having established and developed policies and guidelines, we will build a value chain management system while strengthening related in-house measures. By following the steps shown below, in fiscal 2022 we will formulate and introduce a value chain monitoring system that incorporates human rights due diligence and ascertain the actual status of risks related to the environment, human rights, and governance. Beginning from fiscal 2023, MOL will conduct activities aimed at reducing the risks identified while disclosing details of initiatives in a timely and appropriate manner to ensure accountability to stakeholders.

#### **Steps That Will Establish Value Chain Management**

![img-141.jpeg](img-141.jpeg)

#### **Institutes in Partnership with Chartered Vessel Owners**

To ensure high levels of safety throughout our fleet, we not only apply the MOL Safety Standard Specifications to our owned vessels but also to vessels procured under medium- to long-term charter contracts. An additional aspect of our efforts to heighten safety levels involves actively sharing safety awareness and exchanging information and opinions with shipowners through visits to their vessels and offices as well as the holding of periodic liaison meetings with shipowners. Through such activities, we detect problems at an early stage and take prompt countermeasures. Also, we revise the MOL Safety Standard Specifications whenever necessary.

In 2020, an accident off Mauritius—in which the WAKASHAE, a bulker chartered by MOL, ran aground and spilled oil—had a considerable impact on the local communities and the natural environment. Even though shipowners are legally liable for accidents involving chartered vessels, we understand the social responsibility that we have to take measures aimed at preventing the recurrence of such an accident. In response to the WAKASHAE accident we are strengthening measures to ensure the safety levels of chartered vessels. To further enhance the effectiveness of these measures, in relation to safety levels, we will establish KPIs, develop databases, expand and enhance management and support systems, and introduce new safety technologies. Partnering with shipowners, we will advance initiatives with a view to realizing world-leading safety levels.

#### **Institutes in Partnership with Vessel Recycling Yards**

Upon reaching the end of their service lives, vessels must be scrapped (recycled) to ensure the safe operation of fleets and marine environmental protection. By weight, approximately 95.0% of a vessel is recyclable, and we have our owned vessels recycled by selling them to companies that specialize in vessel purchasing. Meanwhile, as vessel recycling is a labor-intensive industry, the major vessel recycling yards are located in developing countries. At these yards, the management of hazardous substances, environmental impact, and the occupational health and safety of laborers have become matters of international concern. To address such vessel recycling-related issues, the Hong Kong Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships (the Hong Kong Convention) was adopted by the International Maritime Organization in May 2009, and countries are advancing their respective ratification processes with a view to effectuation of the convention. The convention prohibits or limits the loading and use of hazardous materials on board vessels and requires the preparation and updating of inventory lists that record the quantities and locations of hazardous materials on board. Ultimately, this information must be provided to vessel recycling yards. Further, the convention obligates vessel recycling yards to establish appropriate management systems for personnel safety and waste disposal.

#### **MOL Group Vessel Recycling Policy**

In realizing more sustainable vessel recycling, we believe that vessel recycling yards must not only protect the environment and prevent occupational safety issues but also respect the human rights of workers.

- We only select vessel recycling yards that have received third-party certification from Nippon Kaiji Kyokai, commonly known as ClassNK, for compliance with the Hong Kong Convention as well as prescribed environmental, safety, and labor standards.
- Even after vessels have been sold to companies that specialize in vessel purchasing and delivered to vessel recycling yards, we visit the yards to check the progress of vessel breaking work and require yards to provide us with detailed reports.

# Glossary (In alphabetical order)

## CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage)

### CCU (Carbon Capture and Utilization)

CCU is a technology for capturing and storing carbon dioxide before it is released into the atmosphere at plants and power stations. CCU is a technology for using captured carbon dioxide to make fuel and chemicals. Combining these two technologies is called CCUS (Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage).

## Chemical Tankers

Tankers fitted with multiple tanks to transport many different types of liquid chemical cargo at the same time. These tankers have complex design specifications, as they are equipped with independent pipelines, cargo pumps, and temperature-regulating functions for each tank, in addition to dedicated facilities for cleaning and other features.

## Clean Ammonia

This is ammonia produced using technologies that do not emit GHG. Clean ammonia is broadly classified into two types: blue and green. Blue ammonia is produced from fossil fuels, but the CO2 generated is captured and stored. Green ammonia is derived from renewable energy sources. The use of clean ammonia technologies in combination with ammonia-fueled vessels, which are currently under development, promises to advance low-carbon marine transport.

### FPSO (Floating Production, Storage and Offloading System)

An FPSO is a floating facility that produces, stores and offloads oil and gas. Crude oil produced and stored offshore is directly loaded into shuttle tankers for transport.

### FSRU (Floating Storage and Regasification Unit)

### FSU (Floating Storage Unit)

An FSU is a floating facility for storing LNG offshore. An FSRU has the same structure as an FSU with an additional function for regasification of LNG onboard, with which it can send out vaporized natural gas to land through a pipeline. FSRUs and FSUs are being adopted for a growing number of projects to establish LNG receiving terminals all over the world because of their advantages, including a shorter lead time and lower costs compared to conventional onshore receiving terminals.

### ICP (Internal Carbon Pricing)

ICP is a system that sets a feed in-house price for GHG emissions. The system enables the quantification of GHG emission reductions as positive economic impacts. Therefore, it promotes low-carbon investments that would otherwise generally be viewed as cost-increasing factors. ICP is also expected to mitigate carbon tax and other future charges on GHG emissions.

### IMO (International Maritime Organization)

A United Nations specialized agency that promotes intergovernmental cooperation on technical and legal issues affecting international shipping, such as maritime safety, navigation efficiency, and prevention of marine pollution. It also creates a regulatory framework for the shipping industry that is fair and effective, universally adopted, and universally implemented.

## LNG Carriers

Tankers designed for the transportation of liquefied natural gas (LNG). To transport LNG which has been cooled to –162°C, LNG carriers make use of a wide variety of technologies in various ship parts, including specialized tanks that can withstand extremely cold temperatures and emergency shut-off devices to prevent accidents in cargo operation.

## NOx

Nitrogen oxide (NOx) is a cause of atmospheric pollution, and it is created when nitrogen combines with oxygen in the air under high temperatures, like when fuel is combusted inside engines. NOx emissions from ships are regulated by IMO rules, and the third set of NOx regulations went into effect in 2016.

### PBCFs (Propeller Boss Cap Fins)

Developed by MOL in collaboration with two other companies in 1987, these energy-saving devices are attached to the propeller shafts of vessel propulsion engines. Propeller blade rotation generates vortices that lead to energy loss. By eliminating these vortices, PBCFs reduce fuel consumption by approximately 5.0%. As of April 2022, our PBCFs have been installed in approximately 3,700 vessels of all types. Moreover, in 2021 PBCFs were certified as the "Best-selling Energy-Saving Ship Appendage Brand" by Guinness World Records.

## RoRo (Roll-on / Roll-off Ships)

These ships have rampways that allow vehicles to be driven on and off the ship. They can also transport trucks and trailers loaded with cargo. Some ships equipped with RoRo systems are pure car carriers, which mainly transport vehicles that are not loaded with cargo and construction machines. Other RoRo ships are ferries that transport cargo vehicles, passengers, and privately owned vehicles.

## Small- and Medium-Sized Bulkers

Panamax, Handymax, and Handysize dry bulkers that mainly transport general bulk cargo, such as coal, grain, salt, cement, and steel products.

## SOx

SOx encompasses sulfur dioxide (SO2) and other sulfur oxides, which are substances that pollute the atmosphere when oil, coal, and other fossil fuels that contain sulfur is incinerated. In the shipping industry, SOx emissions in the exhaust gas of ships are regulated, and in January 2020, regulations were tightened, greatly reducing the allowable sulfur content in bunker fuel from 3.5% to less than 0.5% (general sea areas).

## Subsea Support Vessels

Vessels designed for installation and maintenance of subsea facilities during production and exploitation of offshore oil and gas fields.

## Synthetic Methane/Methanation

This is methane produced from CO2 and hydrogen. Like natural gas, synthetic methane can be used as a marine fuel. Methanation is the process used to produce synthetic methane. By using CO2 from the atmosphere and hydrogen derived from renewable energy sources as raw materials, CO2 can be cyclically used. This process can significantly lower GHG emissions, which contribute to global warming.

### TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures)

A disclosure framework specializing in climate-related information. It encourages companies to disclose the financial impact climate change has on their business.

## Trim

This refers to the lengthwise inclination of a vessel's hull, which results from the difference between the bow and aft drafts. Normally, trim by aft, where the aft is deeper than the bow, tends to be preferred for ease of vessel handling. However, joint research by MOL and Akishima Laboratories (Mitsui Zosen) Inc. demonstrated that optimum trim by bow improves propulsion efficiency. MOL is endeavoring to improve fuel efficiency by developing and introducing to vessels software that analyzes the optimum trim for each vessel depending on its draft, speed, and route as well as such factors as weather conditions.
