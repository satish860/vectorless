## BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

# JOINT MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND CEO.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

2022 was another challenging year for us all. We had to collectively manage the pandemic's most perennial effects and the sudden effects on the global economy and, consequently, on the banking sector, of the start of the war in Ukraine triggered by the Russian invasion in February.

In addition to the humanitarian catastrophe and uncertainty created in terms of worldwide geopolitics, highly significant economic repercussions have been felt across the world, in contrast to the positive outlook existing at the beginning of the year, based on an easing of restrictions associated with the pandemic, resolution of global logistics constraints, high levels of private savings and the recovery of the labour market.

This new framework was responsible for continued upward revisions of inflation forecasts across the year, which negatively impacted household disposable income and led to widespread uncertainty that affected consumption and investment decisions. Another contributory factor was a rapid reversal of the interest rate cycle, which, as opposed to expectations at the start of the year, led them once again into positive territory. This had the effect of increasing economic constraints, although its effects on net interest income from banking activity were positive.

Caixa remained strong and resilient in such an environment owing to the dedication and commitment of its teams and the trust of its customers and other stakeholders. We continued to focus on developing solutions to meet our customers' needs while, at the same time, contributing to the economic and social support and development of the community.

We have, at the same time, operated on the basis of our commitment to an ethical approach, transparency and social responsibility in all activities, as agents of positive change in society, contributing to sustainable development and the wellbeing of all those with whom we are associated.

The year 2022 consolidated a period of positive developments for Caixa, resulting from the implementation of its 2021-2024 strategic plan and continuation of the bank's transformation cycle. The plan includes a clear strategy for the future, with the aim of providing solutions to meet the financial needs of Portuguese households and companies, investing in the excellence and simplicity of customer service and furthering a business model aligned with best practice in terms of profitability and environmental, social and governance sustainability, strengthening Caixa's leading position in the Portuguese market.

Our commercial dynamics on different fronts contributed to a €3.6 billion annual growth in our business revenue, fuelled by the growth of both credit and domestic and international resources.

**António Farinha Morais**
Chairman of the board of directors

The personal customers' sector, in Portugal, witnessed growth in the level of mortgage loans and the development of our new Crédito Expresso offer as the main driver of the sharp growth in consumer credit (up 42% over 2021). As an insurance broker, Caixa has boosted its offer of non-financial insurance, particularly in health and life insurance associated with mortgages. We have also strengthened our lead in the means of payment area with 4.6 million cards, surpassing the historic milestone of more than 3 million personal customers with a Caixa debit card. As regards companies, our continued support to the economy was, inter alia, reflected in a 10% growth of the SME credit portfolio. These results are based on a culture of risk and rigor in balance sheet management.

As leaders in the financial sector, we remain committed to providing customers with the most efficient, customised, innovative and technologically advanced solutions. To this end, we have invested in improving the efficiency of processes to deliver the fastest and safest banking experiences while maintaining high standards of service.

Caixa's digital transformation process has contributed to a significant increase in new active digital customers, to a group total of 2.9 million. There has also been growth in the number of users of the mobile channel, online sales and customers' levels of satisfaction and recommendation.

In 2022 we achieved a consolidated net profit of €843 million, involving a contribution of €193 million from our existing international entities – its highest ever amount. This result supports our proposal to pay the largest dividend in Caixa's history, for the amount of €352 million and continues to help repay taxpayers for their endeavours in terms of the recapitalisation process.

Caixa's results have also enabled it to continue to ensure the principle of adequate remuneration for its employees and safeguarding of conditions in the context of the pension fund whose liabilities were transferred to Caixa Geral de Aposentações at the beginning of 2023, based on the payment of financial compensation. This operation permitted a reduction of management-related risk levels in results and the balance sheet and brings Caixa's operating conditions more into line with those of its European peers.

Caixa continued to enjoy a robust capital position that is above the average of Portuguese and European banks with tier 1 and total ratios of 18.7% and 20.2%, respectively. This year witnessed a significant reduction of €624 million in

non-performing assets, contributing, inter alia, to a further downward revision of the capital requirements established by the supervisor. The development of the business model supported by a solid capital position and the maintenance of ample liquidity, in compliance with the best risk management practices, contributed to an assessment by the supervisor which resulted in a new downward revision of future capital requirements.

Caixa has maintained a strong culture of social and environmental responsibility which is reflected in its business model and supported by its sustainability strategy for the period 2021-2024 that materialises Caixa's ambition to be the leader in terms of sustainable financing in Portugal, supporting the transition to a low carbon economy and in its funding of projects with a social impact on people's lives.

Financial products and services were developed in support of households and companies in terms of energy transition, efficient buildings and sustainable mobility across 2022. The importance of the ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) rating in the lending process and approach to customers was reinforced and inclusive digital solutions, such as Caixa's digital assistant, developed. Finally, two "green" issuances were launched, which, together with the "sustainable" issuance of 2021, raised total ESG issuances to €1.3 billion.

In short, 2022 was a challenging year. The world economy has faced an unprecedented series of events, ranging from the global pandemic to the social and economic impacts caused by the war, which have generated volatility in the financial market. Notwithstanding these obstacles, Caixa has once again shown its adaptability and resilience in continuing to grow, innovate and transform, to meet the future challenges of sustainably.

We are proud of our financial results, our strong culture of social and environmental responsibility, our commitment to technology and innovation and promotion of a positive, stimulating work environment for all employees. We believe that these are the pillars upon which our present status is based and which can provide us with a future of continued success.

A bank's success, however, is not only measured in numbers. We believe that a bank's true strength lies in its capacity to have a positive impact on people's lives. It is on this premise that we undertake to continue to evolve. With the trust of our stakeholders and the dedication of our teams, we believe that we can face any challenge and turn goals into reality.

Together we will go even further.

# 1.2. Highlights in 2022 

In 2022, business was further improved by CGD's continued implementation of its 2021-2024 strategic plan, in particular in four areas:

## Leadership with strong dynamics in serving Families and Corporates

Business volume was up $2 \%$ by $€ 3.6$ billion over the end of 2021 , evolving both in terms of credit (up $€ 1$ billion) and customer resources, on and off balance sheet (up $€ 2.6$ billion), driven by both domestic and international operations.

Customer deposits in Portugal were up 6\% by $€ 3.9$ billion in 2022. Particular reference should be made to the corporate segment (up 10\%), confirming customers' confidence in CGD. CGD also strengthened its lead of the unit trust investment funds segment, with a 2 p.p. increase in its market share to $37 \%$.

Reference should be made to credit agreements in the corporate segment, with a market share of $16.5 \%$. This particularly included loans to SMEs, which contributed to credit portfolio growth of $10 \%$ in this segment.

CGD led the market with more than $€ 3$ billion in mortgage agreements in terms of personal customer business in Portugal. Consumer credit, in 2022, was up 14\% by $€ 128$ million. CGD's new Crédito Expresso offer, based on simplicity and rapid approval, continues to be the main driver of such strong growth.

CGD made a decisive contribution to digital inclusion in the means of payment business, with more than 3 million customers having debit cards. There were 2.2 million active digital banking customers at the end of December 2022, up 18\% in terms of mobile users to 1.5 million. Sales on digital channels in terms of CGD's activity in Portugal totalled $€ 80$ million.

## Historical levels of International results and Dividend

Caixa Geral de Depósitos group's consolidated net income was up $44.5 \%$ over 2021 to $€ 843$ million, comprising a return on equity (ROE) of $9.8 \%$, which, compared to the average of ROE for the period 20112022 of $-1.3 \%$, evidences the consolidation of the recovery initiated in recent years.

In addition to the growth of credit portfolios, the evolution of the ECB's key reference rates fuelled a $44 \%$ increase of $€ 429$ million in net interest income, a large proportion of which comprised treasury operations in Portugal (up $€ 172$ million, including the impact of ECB's TLTRO programme) and international activity (up $€ 119$ million).

The overall contribution of international activity to the group's net income was up $44 \%$ over 2021 to $€ 193$ million, being the highest result ever of the international entities currently held.

According to the dividends policy, this result of $€ 352$ million was the largest dividend ever paid by CGD and continued to contribute to a better return on invested capital and to repaying the endeavours of taxpayers under the recapitalisation process.

The current cost-to-income ratio continued to decline steadily to $39.1 \%$, with sustained efficiency levels and improved earnings.

## Sustained improvement in Reputation and Capital Strength

The CGD brand was cross-recognized by several studies: as the banking brand with the greatest spontaneous notoriety, due to its Reputation which, since 2017, has maintained a rating higher than that of the banking sector in Portugal, and as the most attractive Brand to new customers for the third consecutive year.

The sustainability strategy for the 2021-2024 period embodies CGD's aim of being the leader in sustainable financing in Portugal, backing the transition to a low carbon economy and financing projects with a social impact on people's lives. Two operations with "green" characteristics were carried out which, together with the "sustainable" issuance of 2021, bring total ESG issuances to $€ 1.3$ billion as part of a continuous commitment to achieving sustainable financing objectives. CGD was subject to the SSM Climate Risk Stress Test 2022 conducted by the European Central Bank (ECB) involving a total of 104 banks, with CGD achieving an above-average overall score.

CGD continues to enjoy a strong capital position that is above the average of Portuguese and European banks. Its tier 1 and total ratios stood at $18.7 \%$ and $20.2 \%$, respectively, including net profit, net of the maximum distributable amount according to the dividend payment ratio of the previous year.

The supervisor reduced capital requirements (Pillar 2) from 2.0\% to 1.9\% at the beginning of 2023 and for the second consecutive year. This reflected an improvement in the perception of risk attached to CGD.

The MREL ratio of $27.82 \%$ exceeded the requirement applicable starting 2024, resulting from the positive evolution of shareholders' equity and the two senior preferred debt issuances of $€ 800$ million in 2022 on international markets.

The rating assigned by the international agencies improved in 2022, reflecting a favorable evolution in their perception of Caixa's risk. Fitch Ratings raised Caixa's IDR and senior long-term preferred debt ratings from BB+ to BBB-, placing Caixa at investment grade level by the three international agencies that assign it rating. DBRS confirmed Caixa's rating at BBB, having revised the Trend from Negative to Positive and, already in January 2023, Moody's raised the deposit rating outlook to "Positive".

# Significant reinforcement of Balance Sheet Quality 

CGD continued to improve asset quality in 2022 with declines in its NPL ratio and good performance in terms of the recovery and reduction of assets for disposal. The NPL ratio was down to $2.4 \%$, while the NPL ratio, net of total impairment, remained at $0 \%$.

Non-performing assets decreased by $€ 624$ million, as a result of the reduction in exposure to restructuring funds, the sale of properties held for sale (which reached the lowest value since 2008) and the recovery of defaulted loans.

The recovery activity continued to show good results, with a $€ 283$ million decrease in stock in recovery. Portfolio evolution and recovery activity resulted in a negative $0.01 \%$ cost of credit risk. Reference should also be made to the $27 \%$ reduction in properties held-for-sale to $€ 291$ million in addition to a $53 \%$ decrease in exposure to restructuring funds to $€ 205$ million.

CGD transferred all pension fund liabilities to Caixa Geral de Aposentações in 2023, having extinguished and liquidated the fund and paid financial compensation for the liabilities transferred to it. This operation makes it possible to reduce the risks resulting from the volatility deriving from the size of the pension fund, nature of its assets and liabilities and the accounting and prudential treatment in the bank's profit and loss statement and balance sheet. It also represents a major step towards bringing CGD's operating conditions more into line with those of other banks in the context of the European market. The impacts on results and in equity, resulting from this transfer, were reflected in advance in the 2022 accounts.

In 2022 reorganization of the CGD Group, aiming to simplify the structure by reducing the number of holding companies and carried out through merger or dissolution of associated companies, highlighting the sale of ESEGUR that took place in July 2022, the acquisition of 11,687 shares in August, representing 11.69\% of Banco Interatlântico, from a 70\% stake to $81.687 \%$ of the bank's share capital, and in December the merger of the stake held in Caixa Banco de Investimento by Caixa Participações, followed by the compulsory acquisition of the shares still on the market ( $0.23 \%$ ) with the latter being fully owned by CGD.

The structure resulting from this reorganization aims to achieve a higher profitability in future years by eliminating operating costs for the CGD.

Section 3.4 of this report ("Group Structure") details the changes in terms of acquisition and disposal of group structure.

## Human resources

The Group had 11,178 employees at 31 December 2022, 293 fewer than in December 2021 in line with the technological evolution of CGD and the banking market. Despite the net reduction registered, CGD retained its ability to renew and rejuvenate, having carried out, in Portugal, 129 hires in the year and 470 paid internships since the launch of the Caixa Geração Program in 2020.

In Portugal, promotions were carried out involving 19\% of the number of employees and the attribution of commercial incentives and a Performance and Potential Bonus was maintained, involving around 85\% of the employees, which together represented 16.3 million euros in 2022. In December an extraordinary payment of 900 or 600 euros was attributed to employees with remuneration lower than 2,700 euros to mitigate the effects of the unexpected increase in inflation.

With the aim of increasing employee training, in 2022 CGD reinforced its investment in training which, in the last three years, has amounted to around $€ 5$ million.

This edition took place in face-to-face format, with more than 2,000 employees.

In maintaining its commitment to equality and non-discrimination, the Plan for Gender Equality in Caixa Group was updated, listing the level of achievement of the measures identified in 2021 and adding new initiatives aimed at strengthening the response in the various dimensions of the Plan.

# Caixa Brand 

## Brand

CGD monitors and analyses the evolution and trends of the main attributes and indicators provided by studies in Portugal - BrandScore, RepScore, Powerful Brand and The Banker - on the CGD brand and its status in the banking sector. Various studies, in 2022, award CGD highly positive scores in terms of reputation in the eyes of consumers who continue to recognise CGD as Portugal's benchmark bank.

According to the RepScore study, CGD was also the leading brand in terms of emotional reputation in the Portuguese financial sector, in 2022. The emotional aspect of reputation evaluates attributes such as admiration, relevance, preference and recommendation. The evolution of the evaluation of CGD brand's reputation has remained positive since 2017, outperforming the rest of the banking sector in Portugal.

The CGD brand, in 2022, was once again awarded Powerful Brand status in the "Banks" category of the Marktest group's Powerful Brand - Brands with Value for the 2nd consecutive year. The Powerful Brand study measures the value of brands on the basis of KPIs (key performance Indicators) analysed in terms of brand innovation, sustainability and purpose.

In July 2022, the UK Banker magazine, from the Financial Times group, recognised CGD as the number 1 bank in Portugal in the TOP 1000 World Banks publication.

CGD was, once again the banking brand with the greatest appeal to new customers, in 2022, confirming the recognition of the CGD brand by those who are not, as yet, customers, as analysed by the BrandScore study of the Scopen consultancy company.

According to this study, the assessment of the Caixa Geral de Depósitos brand's reputation indicator remained highly positive in 2022, outperforming the banking sector average in Portugal. The indicator with the best evaluation, also in the banking context, is "Relevance", which translates the recognition of CGD in the Portuguese financial sector.

## Institutional Communication

Encontros Fora da Caixa (conference cycles) continued to be a meeting point between Caixa and civil society, in 2022, contributing to a collective vision of the country and strengthening the institution's ties with the business sector.

Topics related to current economic and business, regional and national issues were discussed and analysed at each conference in light of the European and global situation.

Caixa organised these discussions in nine nationwide locations in 2022 (Porto, Ilha do Pico, Sines, Vila Nova de Famalicão, Oeiras, Covilhã, Funchal, Figueira da Foz and Lisbon), attended by more than 3,500 guests in addition to live broadcasts and streaming transmissions of the respective content.

Each of these meetings also hosted cultural events, with music and poetry in the voice of Pedro Abrunhosa and Nicolau Santos. Such moments also gave rise to "disruptive" conversations with national reference personalities such as: Luís Marques Mendes, Francisco George, Rui Moreira, Luís Valente de Oliveira, or Francisco Simões.

Caixa's presence across the year involved the participation of its executive board members at several institutional events related, inter alia, to financial sector, governance, ESG and innovation issues.

Also during the year, the usual press conferences were organized for the presentation of results, a unique opportunity to render accounts to society and clarify the most relevant aspects of the activity's development, framed in the market and economic context.

# Commercial Communication 

2022 began with the launch of the Crédito Expresso campaign, involving operations by Caixa in a territory in which it had not, as yet, been active, in the form of fast, personal loans, with a decision in 24 hours and accounts credited in 48 hours. This campaign, which adapted a well-known song by Deolinda: "If it has to be, let it be now," was one of Caixa's most successful campaigns in the year according to the results of the Brandscore 2022 study.

With the aim of improving the communication of innovative solutions, this was followed, in February, by the launch of the "Digital Assistant" advertising campaign which publicised this pioneering solution in Portugal's banking sector.

Reference should also be made, in the first six months, to the February announcement of the Caixa Social prizes disclosing information on this annual initiative that distinguishes and provides financial support to the work of entities operating in the third sector and the June launch of the PRR PT2030 campaign for corporate applications in respect of the financial incentives of this Caixa-backed programme.

CGD launched a series of sectoral campaigns in the second half year, targeted at companies (foreign trade, tourism, commerce and services and industry), in which it reaffirmed its supporting role in terms of financing the national business sector.

The Multicare Health Insurance and Retirement Savings Solutions campaigns were launched in November and December, to provide information on the health protection and retirement planning solutions marketed by CGD.

## Support for culture

CGD's mission letter, once again, stated that: "The mission of Caixa Geral de Depósitos is to create value for Portuguese society".

This value creation can not only be measured in numbers but can also involve investment in the community in which Caixa operates, with investment in Culture necessarily contributing to the construction of a better society.

Caixa increased the amount of its investment in culture, across 2022, in launching several innovative programmes and continuing or increasing investment in already existing projects.
![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)

Caixa supported, in 2022, the launch of works related to Management, Finance, Economy and Current Affairs, such as the book Strategic Autonomy and Economic Power: The Economy, by Vítor Bento, the Manual of Corporate Governance | Theory and Practice for Scholars, Executive and Non-Executive Directors by Duarte Pitta Ferraz and also the book «Impostos: Porquê e para quê?» by Paulo Marques and Joaquim Miranda Sarmento.

In partnership with the Institute of Economic, Financial and Tax Law - IDEFF, Caixa also promoted a cycle of 10 conferences "Thinking about the Economy: ten books, ten fundamental debates", under the scientific coordination of Prof. Doctor Eduardo Paz Ferreira, where the set of economic policy guidelines imposed by the implementation of the Recovery and Resilience Plan - PRR was debated, in light of the analysis of the authors of economics books published in recent years.

In addition to Culturgest's activity and programme, the central atrium of Caixa's headquarters building hosted three exhibitions. The exhibition of works from the Caixa Collection, the exhibition "People from Batalha", by António Barreto (curated by Ângela Camila Castelo-Branco), which sought to portray in black and white the magnificence of the Monastery of Batalha and the exhibition "Duarte Darmas - From Cálamo to Drone", by Santiago Macias, Director of the National Pantheon, who highlighted Duarte Darmas, a squire of the Royal House who, in the service of King D. Manuel I, in the early 16th century, surveyed the raianas fortifications.

# Fundação Caixa Geral de Depósitos (Caixa Geral de Depósitos Foundation) 

Caixa's support for the widest range of cultural activities has been publicly acknowledged. Reference should be made to its support for the Culturgest Foundation as a private foundation with the object of performing cultural, artistic and scientific activities.

The Culturgest Foundation has been granted "public utility" status owing to the merit of its not-for-profit activities.

Since opening its doors, the foundation has played a significant role in developing the artistic environment in city and country. It has accompanied the careers of stage directors and choreographers, creating new productions and presenting them to a diverse audience, has commissioned works from visual artists, sponsoring solo and group exhibitions, organising all kinds of music concerts and supporting and hosting the city's major film festivals.

This programme has been complemented by conferences and debates and a diversified range of workshops, guided tours, meetings and events for schools and families, at the service of the community in which it operates.

## Caixa competition for young artists (1st edition)

The first competition for artists between the ages of 25 and 35 was held in 2022. This competition aims to acknowledge and stimulate the artistic production of young people in the visual arts field.

This initiative opens a new chapter in the history of Caixa's contemporary art collection, opening doors to younger generations with the aim of promoting its consolidation and qualification.

This competition included acquisitions of creations by six artists - Adriana Progranó, Dayana Lucas, Fernão Cruz, Igor Jesus, João Gabriel and Sara Mealha - whose works are now housed in the collection. The decision regarding the winners was made by the CGD collection's procurement committee chaired by Emílio Rui Vilar.

The Caixa Geral de Depósitos Foundation - Culturgest, as the CGD collection's management appointee, is also responsible for its procurement policy and the judicious implementation thereof pursuant to which it has made several acquisitions of relevance across the year.

## Caixa in Culturgest

Another Caixa concert cycle was held at Culturgest, in 2022. This initiative aims to publicise Culturgest's activity to a wider audience.

This cycle seeks to support the best music in Portugal. This initiative comprised 6 concerts: Amália Hoje (2), Mariza, Sétima Legião (2) and Orquestra Geração, attended by around 3,000 spectators, enabling Caixa to reinforce its image as a promoter of culture.

## Caixa's cultural programme

This programme developed from 2021 with the purpose of funding unequivocally high quality, distinctive, decentralising, creative projects that contribute to the country's cultural development. The objective of this programme is to provide financial support to artistic and cultural creation in the areas of theatre, dance, music, the visual arts, cinema, literature, performances, conferences and debates.

Caixa's cultural programme distinguished a set of eight initiatives, in two editions, in 2022:

- 10 Artists - Textile in Portuguese Art (Ideias Emergentes), an exhibition held under the aegis of Contextile 2022 - Bienal de Arte Têxtil Contemporânea.

# 1.3.4. CGD Portugal - Commercial Activity and Digital Transformation 

The retail network retained its commercial dynamics of 2022, particularly in terms of credit (real estate and business), investment products, health insurance and cards.

Caixa led in the field of mortgage lending having entered into agreements for more than $€ 3$ billion and achieving a portfolio of more than $€ 25$ billion which, notwithstanding the signs of a slowdown as a result of highly significant market changes, allowed it to consolidate its market share at around $24 \%$.

The consumer credit portfolio was up $14 \%$ by $€ 128$ million in 2022 and agreements up by around $42 \%$, in comparison to the preceding year. Its new Crédito Expresso offer, based on a user-friendly, fast approval approach, continues to spear this strong growth and improved profitability.

## CONSUMER CREDIT

Million euros
![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)

Includes Consumer credit, credit cards and others

Reference should be made to a market share of $16.5 \%$ in credit agreements for the corporate segment. Special reference should be made to credit to SMEs, which contributed to credit portfolio growth of $10 \%$ in this segment.

Reference should be made in business terms to an acceleration of global performance contributing to strengthening Caixa's status as a corporate bank. Support for micro and small enterprises has translated into around 10 thousand new customers.

A positive level of performance was achieved by such commissions-earning products as: Contas Caixa (Caixa accounts) with an additional 96 thousand active accounts in the case of personal customers (totalling 2.1 million accounts) and an additional 15 thousand Caixa Business corporate accounts; the acquiring service, with a $34 \%$ increase in commissions over 2021, with a $15 \%$ market share having been achieved in respect of automatic payment terminals; a highly favourable evolution in the case of credit cards and accelerating sales in terms of health insurance, leveraged by the Ofereça Saúde campaign.

# Personal customers 

Personal customer management in 2022 continued to focus on the Caixa Platinum, Caixa Azul and mass market segments, with a particular concern in mitigating the economic and social consequences of rising inflation and evolution of interest rates. Reference should be made to the following measures for private customers:

- An exceptional, temporary scheme for the penalty-free redemption/reimbursement of retirement and savings plans for education (PPRs and PPR/Es);
- Support and oversight of personal borrowers in credit operations involving the acquisition or construction of permanent own housing, subject to a series of requirements.

In seeking to respond to the changes that have been occurring in the money market, Caixa launched its Depósito Pequeno Alorrador (small savers deposit) for its personal and self-employed business customers. This is a simple 1-year non-renewable term deposit, which enables early withdrawals. It also introduced its Depósito Caixa 15 Meses Não Renovável account as a simple 15 month term deposit account which does not permit withdrawals and which cannot be renewed. Caixa also increased its interest rates on term deposits in foreign currency.

With the aim of strengthening the level of its engagement with customers, Caixa has continued to adopt a strategy of strengthening financial solutions geared to meet different needs with various initiatives in different customer relationship areas such as: home purchases and projects (based on improvements and innovations in terms of mortgages and personal loans); day-to-day financial management (through Caixa Accounts, Caixadirecta and various initiatives related to easier access to Caixa); investing (promoting the launch of new investment products, such as life insurance, PPRs (retirement plans) and funds; safeguarding the future (by strengthening coverage and other healthcare innovations together with other non-financial solutions) and savings (adjustments to term deposits, savings accounts, funds and financial insurance). All of these initiatives were based on communication actions and the possibility of remote subscriptions/contracts which benefit from continuous functional improvements.

Caixa has increased its level of support for the university segment over the years, based on the following pillars: support for the academic community; knowledge promotion; promotion of access to higher education and economic-social and cultural responsibility. Forty six higher educational institutions benefited from a Caixa investment of $€ 7.5$ million under the Caixa IU - Polytechnics Institutes and Universities programme in 2022.

Caixa continued to provide a collection of microcredit solutions to combat poverty and social exclusion, based on lines of credit for entrepreneurship and own job creation, resulting from partnerships with CASES, IEFP (Institute of Employment and Professional Training) and the European Investment Fund. These

partnerships help facilitate access to credit by a customer segment which is often a victim of social exclusion. These solutions particularly include the Microinvest, Investe+, Jovem Empreendedor (Young Entrepreneur) and Caixa Invest Social Projeto (social projects) lines of credit, which have helped encourage the creation of small businesses, which are crucial for the sustainable creation and maintenance of jobs.

Caixa has been providing minimum banking services since 2000 following the three-party agreement entered into between Caixa, the government and the Bank of Portugal pursuant to the provisions of decree law 27-C/2000 of March 2000, with the objective of providing its customers with access to the banking system, notwithstanding their financial status. This service is currently for personal customers who only have one account in the banking system and includes, in addition to the maintenance and management of a current deposit account, access to the Caixadirecta service, a debit card and the following banking operations: deposits, withdrawals, payments of goods and services, direct debits and transfers. Caixa is the market leader with a share of $38.1 \%$.

# Digital banking 

CGD consolidated its leadership as the digital bank of Portuguese citizens, in 2022, with significant growth in the number of active digital customers and its remote business.

## ACTIVE DIGITAL CUSTOMERS

Million customers
![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)

CGD's domestic market total of 2.2 million active digital personal and corporate customers, comprised $65 \%$ of its customer base and growth of $8 \%$ over the same period last year. Reference should also be made to the increasing relevance of the $18 \%$ year-on-year growth of the mobile channel to 1.5 million personal and corporate customers.

The increase in the number of digital customers helped to increase the proportion of online sales to $80 \%$ (up $7 \%$ year-on-year). It also improved satisfaction levels and recommendations of digital channels. According to the BrandScore 4Q 2022 study, 58\% of customers recommend CGD channels.

Throughout the year, innovation was placed at the heart of customer service. This proved to be essential to ensure greater satisfaction with the service, generating more accesses and more business. Caixadirecta had more than 275 million accesses in December, with the app accounting for $85 \%$ of logins.

The total number of 84 million operations was also significantly up by $12 \%$ over the same period last year. The contact centre which, since 2021, has been equipped with a virtual assistant to ensure a more efficient customer service, recorded high average levels of satisfaction.

The digital business, which has evolved significantly since CGD embarked upon its transformation programme, has seen strong growth in subscriptions for such online products as Crédito Pessoal Expresso, with more than 6,000 subscriptions, non-financial insurance with around 7,000 subscriptions and the opening of financial assets accounts with growth of $44 \%$. In the corporate segment, reference should be made to the $110 \%$ growth of short term loans and $22 \%$ growth of factoring and confirming operations.

The Caixadirecta app with its strong innovation component focusing on customer needs, continues to be the Portuguese banking app with the highest number of users and the largest number of reviews in app stores. This solution's various innovations in the last quarter of the year, particularly include, inter alia, the

Multicare insurance simulator, online subscriptions for PPR Evoluir (retirement plans) and a new feature allowing users to place orders for non-financial products.

The digital assistant, as a benchmark solution in the national banking sector, not only on account of its transactional component but also as an inclusive solution, registered an accumulated annual total of 3.6 million accesses. In comparison to the same period, the number of consultations using the assistant was up by $34 \%$ and the number of transactions by $93 \%$. This not only shows the usefulness of the voice service but also the confidence of users, who can now use the assistant to apply for credit cards.

DABOX continues to be the leading open banking app in Portugal, with a market share of 34\% (according to the SIBS API Market data for 4Q 2022). It now permits views of balances and movements on the Caixa Break card.

In the corporate segment Caixa has increased the number of Caixadirecta Empresas features, increasing the speed of execution of operations and access to immediate liquidity. Special reference should be made to: factoring \& confirming and trade finance operations on digital channels, particularly export and import financing (Finex) for corporate customers with defined contractual limits; applications for and simulations of short term credit; provision of accounting documentation and factoring lists; receipt of financial elements; requests for digital fingerprints on login and point of sales (POS) digital documents sent by email and secure messaging systems.

# Corporate 

## New segmentation model: more services and greater proximity

In order to ensure greater proximity and consolidate its position, Caixa has reviewed its corporate segmentation model to include companies invoicing more than $€ 3$ million in its specialised SME service, with a dedicated account manager and service in special, reserved areas in a Caixa Empresas corporate office space, for around 5,000 companies with growth potential.

Within this new segmentation and to provide corporate network account managers with a more assertive business approach prioritisation model, a new cluster-based model for identifying high potential customers was introduced with the aim of treating different customers in different ways, i.e. companies with the potential to increase product penetration and/or obtain credit.

This new commercial approach has qualified 100\% of the corporate database and was developed using propensity modelling with advanced analysis techniques, complemented by a pre-approved credit risk rating and sectoral fact sheets to support commercial activity which has made it possible to achieve certified efficiency rates in terms of best industry practice.

Reference should also be made to the strengthening of the geographical coverage of CGD's corporate network in the interior of the country with the opening of the Covilhã office, providing better service to the districts of Guarda and Castelo Branco. The corporate network accordingly now comprises a total of 24 offices and 2 extensions for SMEs.

Caixa also reinforced the oversight of its corporate segment (companies invoicing up to $€ 3$ million) in 2022, not only in terms of numbers of customers (with an additional 32 thousand now benefiting from the specialised oversight of a Caixa Negócios manager) but also in terms of their nationwide presence in markets with the highest potential, allowing more customers to benefit from the availability of specialised oversight services.

## Presence in the day-to-day affairs of companies: treasury and means of payment solutions

To support companies in the context of a sharp growth in their working capital needs across 2022, Caixa has provided a series of treasury and means of payment solutions which particularly include its Flexcash electronic platform for treasury management purposes (having already underwritten an amount of more than €2,400 billion since launch), trade finance products for Portuguese companies' exports and imports, which acknowledge Caixa as a supporting partner in their international business and non-financial corporate insurance with various areas of coverage, such as group healthcare and life insurance, multi-risk insurance, freight insurance and motor insurance.

More than 15 thousand Caixa Business accounts were also opened and benefited from the launch of Caixa's corporate account. Caixa's acquiring service continued along a growth trajectory in its transaction values

across 2022, achieving a market share of $15 \%$ at the end of 2022. There was a recovery of in-person payments of around $30.2 \%$ and growth of $62.6 \%$ in online payments, in comparison to 2021.

# Investment support 

In the investment solutions component and notwithstanding such a challenging context, companies continued to invest and Caixa continued to support them. Caixa provided a collection of financing solutions in this area in 2022, of which special reference should be made to the following:

- Caixa EIB line of credit 2021 to meet the investment needs of mid caps, large corporates and public sector entities with links to the health sector;
- Caixa EIF lines of credit, particularly including Start II, to support the transformation of new companies (medium/long term with an EIF guarantee and the Caixa Invest Green Land line of credit in support of environmental sustainability (medium/long term and leasing) under which Caixa has funded more than 16,000 projects, over the last three years;
- Tourism support 2021 line of credit aimed at strengthening working capital and boosting investments in the sector;
- Production support mutual guarantee lines of credit to fund working capital needs resulting from rising raw material and energy costs and disruption in supply chains;
- Investment banking for SME segment customers to identify and provide investment solutions to support the growth of companies in this segment.

Caixa, as a Portuguese state-owned bank and benchmark institution, has also played a proactive market role in its sales of European Funds through its Caixa PRR/Portugal 2030 offer. The integrated offer of European funds, in which Caixa operates side-by-side with its customers at all stages of the lifecycle of applications and business projects, includes:

## Global economic evolution

Global economic activity, in 2022, continued to recover from the unprecedented contraction experienced in 2020. The situation was, however, in marked contrast to the more optimistic prospects envisaged at the beginning of the year, based on the reduction of pandemic-related restrictions and its positive respective impacts in eliminating constraints on goods supply chains, in addition to the high levels of private savings and labour market recovery.

Economic growth, which decelerated sharply, particularly from the second quarter of the year, was negatively affected by three major factors. Firstly, by the return of geopolitics to the series of risks and factors shaping not only sentiment, but also the decisions of various economic actors. Particular reference should be made, herein, to the outbreak of war in Ukraine triggered by the Russian military invasion in February, which has since overshadowed the European and world order. Secondly, by the unexpected magnitude of the reduction in the rate of growth not only of the US but also of the Chinese economy. Lastly, on account of the brutal increase in the cost of living caused by a sharp acceleration in the growth of overall price levels, which forced central banks to gradually accelerate the rate of normalisation of monetary conditions across the year as a whole and particularly in the case of the developed economies.

There was a sharp increase in inflation in 2022, at double-digit year-on-year levels, even in the main economies. The increase largely reflected significant adjustments to the prices of energy raw materials and food products carried over from the previous year, in a context in which constraints on the supply capacity of companies to meet the level of demand for goods remained high. The depreciation of the currencies of several emerging countries added to the strong pressure on the prices of imported goods.

Global economic growth decelerated across the year. According to the International Monetary Fund's (IMF's) most recent estimates GDP growth of $3.4 \%$ in 2022 was much lower than the preceding year's $6.2 \%$ and the projections advanced a year earlier. Growth moderation was registered in both the developed and emerging and developing blocs, at rates of $2.7 \%$ and $3.9 \%$, respectively, in comparison to the preceding year's $5.4 \%$ and $6.7 \%$.

In the United States of America, GDP was up 2.1\% in real terms in 2022, in this case in agreement with the early estimate of the Bureau of Economic Analysis. With the exclusion of 2020, this increase, following the preceding years close to 6.0 pp was the smallest since 2011. This performance reflected a sharp reduction in the domestic demand component, particularly public consumption and the private consumption of consumer durables. Notwithstanding a continuation of favourable labour market dynamics in which unemployment remained historically low (returning to a level of $3.5 \%$ at the end of the year, its lowest of the last five decades), the negative growth of real wages, accompanied by a depreciation of financial assets, dictated a considerable drop in consumer confidence.

In Japan, estimated GDP growth in the eyes of the IMF returned to a level of close to 1 pp after achieving a higher growth rate in 2021 for the first time in a decade. The worldwide inflation shock has affected the Japanese economy, this time with an acceleration of consumer price growth, particularly owing to energyrelated components and, to a lesser extent, food. The year-on-year change in the national index towards the end of the year was close to 4 pp , an event that had not been witnessed for over ten years.

There was also a substantial moderation of economic growth in the euro area across 2022. In a year marked by the launch of the ambitious NextGenerationEU programme, whose first appropriations were distributed in 2021, the growth of activity in the region was particularly affected by the crisis related to price increases and scarcity of energy sources. The euro area, together with its other European Union partners was among the most vulnerable regions owing both to geographical proximity and to a high level of reliance on imports of fossil fuel and food from the regions in which the armed conflict continues to take place. The euro area's GDP that, according to Eurostat, was up $3.5 \%$ in real terms in comparison to $5.3 \%$ in 2021, was more than 2 pp up over the level observed immediately before the outbreak of the pandemic at the end of 2022.

Economic growth has benefited from the positive contribution of domestic demand, particularly owing to the major role played by tourism and other intensive contact activities linked to the service sectors in most member states.

Also taking into account European Commission forecasts for winter 2023, all euro area member states except for Estonia achieved positive, significant GDP growth rates, albeit lower than those of 2021. Particular reference should be made to Portugal, whose annual growth of $6.7 \%$ was supplanted only by Ireland's $12.2 \%$. This was offset by the less favourable performances which, in addition to the referred to Baltic state, were observed in Germany, Latvia and Slovakia, with GDP growth of no more than $1.8 \%$ in the first two cases and $1.5 \%$ in the latter case.

Notwithstanding the slowdown in activity and heightened levels of global uncertainty, the labour market continued to pick up in 2022. In an environment of labour shortages, given the limited growth of the workforce, the percentage of companies reporting difficulties in hiring skilled employees continued to be high in various sectors. Unemployment continued to decline across the year, to successive lows in a market considered to be very close to full employment. Overall, the euro area's average annual unemployment rate stood at $6.7 \%$, in comparison to $7.7 \%$ in 2021.

Inflation in the euro area, as measured by the change in the harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP), again increased more rapidly and persistently than expected, to an annual rate of $8.4 \%$ against $2.6 \%$ in 2021. This was the highest rate ever recorded since the official introduction of the euro and exceeded the European Central Bank's (ECB's) reference rate for the second successive year. The increase in inflation that, close to year-end, reached levels that had not been observed for three decades, was fuelled by the recovery of domestic demand, supply chain constraints and subsequent hikes in energy and food prices following the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine. Excluding food and energy, consumer prices were up 3.9\% in 2022, against $1.5 \%$ in 2021.

There was also sharp moderation in the rate of growth of economic activity in the emerging bloc, mainly owing to a cooling Chinese economy, whose growth, according to the IMF's publication of its latest estimates in its World Economic Outlook (WEO) last January, only slightly exceeded that of the global economy for the first time in many decades. Contracting activity in second quarter 2022, was affected both by the blockages deriving from the rigorous policy of restrictions on mobility related to Covid-19 and the deceleration of investment in the real estate sector. Economic growth in Latin American commodities exporting countries remained relatively high, benefiting from higher prices and the normalisation of activity in intensive contact sectors. Growth in several emerging Asian economies slowed in sync with the slower rate of expansion in China, whereas, in turn, eastern European economies were particularly affected by the war in Ukraine owing to their greater reliance on energy imports from the Russian Federation and contingencies associated with the conflict's physical proximity.

More specifically, China's economy slowed considerably in 2022. According to the National Bureau of Statistics GDP growth was no more than $3.0 \%$, in comparison to $8.4 \%$ in 2021 , which, excluding 2020, was the lowest since 1976. This result also failed to meet the government's $5 \%$ target for last year for the first time. In addition to having been affected by the announcement of strategic measures to deal with the pandemic and real estate crisis, household consumption remained subdued owing to lower levels of consumer confidence, higher levels of savings, a reduction in the growth of disposable income and a tighter labour market. Unemployment was up across the year as a whole to an average annual rate of $5.6 \%$. Lastly, investment in the sector was affected by the referred to worsening of the situation in the real estate sector owing to a reduction of fiscal policy support measures.

Latin America's growth of $3.9 \%$ was around half of that of the previous year ( $7.0 \%$ ) with all economies in the region posting an expansion of economic activity. Eastern Europe, badly affected by the conflict in Ukraine, found itself close to stagnation, according to IMF estimates, largely owing to a contraction of activity in both Russia and Ukraine. In the case of the former, the economy, affected by financial and technological sanctions aimed at pressuring the country to declare an end to hostilities, was down $2.1 \%$, according to the federal statistics service. This result was much less negative than the predictions in the weeks immediately following the military invasion of Ukraine. In the latter case, the conflict since February has not only caused enormous human suffering, owing to the number of deaths, wounded and displacement of millions of people, but also massive losses of fixed capital in infrastructures, resulting in a drop in activity that according to the IMF amounted to $35.0 \%$ at the time of the World Economic Outlook's (WEO) disclosure in October 2022.

As opposed to previous years, growth of $3.8 \%$ in Sub-Saharan Africa was in line with the rest of the world, albeit still down over the preceding year, in this case by slightly less than one percentage point ( $4.7 \%$ in

2021). Among the major emerging countries, reference should, once again, be made to India's economy that according to the IMF, achieved a considerable rate of growth of around $6.8 \%$, albeit down from $8.7 \%$ in 2021.

The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in Angola, continued to wane in 2022. Angola's economy registered a second consecutive year of expansion, this time by $2.9 \%$ in comparison to $0.8 \%$ in 2021 , according to the IMF's WEO of October 2022, having benefited from the increase of oil prices. The non-oil sector has also shown signs of recovery. In a continent badly affected by rising inflation, Angola was an exception to be noted, as the annual growth in prices, although still high, recorded a significant reduction from around 27\% to $14 \%$, largely due to the effect of the relevant appreciation of the national currency, the kwanza.

In Mozambique, following GDP contraction of $1.2 \%$ in 2020 (the first in 30 years) and growth of $2.3 \%$ in 2021, the rate of expansion of economic activity accelerated in 2022 to $3.7 \%$, the best result in five years and in which a significant contribution was made by the total lifting of Covid-19 restrictions from July onwards. In terms of price growth, inflation rose to double digits ( $10.3 \%$ in comparison to $6.4 \%$ ), driven by international fuel and food prices in addition to the tropical storms which affected domestic food supply, particularly in the second quarter. Reference should also be made, at year-end, to the completion of the first review of the agreement between the IMF and Mozambique on an extended credit facility (ECF) programme that aims to support economic recovery and reduce public debt and funding vulnerabilities.

Cape Verde's economy continued to recover from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2022, the IMF's executive board approved a 36 month agreement under the aegis of the ECF for Cape Verde for an amount equivalent to around $\$ 60$ million to help offset funding gaps, together with ongoing funding support from the country's development partners. Following contraction of almost 15\% in 2020, the economy grew 7\% in the following year and accelerated considerably in 2022, particularly during the first half (with an average year-on-year change of $17.4 \%$ ) benefiting from the sharp increase in the number of tourists. Economic activity also benefited from credit growth.

Economic activity in Macau was heavily constrained by the measures imposed by the Chinese authorities owing to the restrictions associated with its zero-Covid policy. Major health control constraints related to visitor arrivals had a particularly negative impact on an economy that is highly reliant on tourism. Macau had 5.7 million visitors in 2022, down $26.0 \%$ over last year. According to the statistics and census service division, this resulted in a $26.8 \%$ contraction of GDP, following a recovery of $19.3 \%$ in the previous year. This is still at a level well below 2019, to be precise, at around $60 \%$.

The decisions of central banks were once again decisive factors in the evolution of the global economy and financial markets, as in previous years, although this time they were highly restrictive and, in several cases such as the case of the ECB, marked by a cumulative increase in interest rates in the space of just one unprecedented year.

The sharp and significant increase in inflationary pressures contributed to a decisive change in the level and, as a result, trajectory of several public finances-related variables. Over the short term the referred to tensions favour variables related to fiscal balances taking into account the benefits in terms of tax revenue, particularly those obtained from indirect taxes. The size of fiscal deficits, in 2022, was down again and even more sharply than in the previous year, as in the developed bloc, although they remained above their pre-pandemic levels in all regions. In comparison to 2019, the largest deficits in advanced economies still reflect higher levels of public expenditure than at the time in question, partly owing to responses to food and, particularly, energy crises, whereas, in emerging economies this mainly derives from the fact that government revenues have still to recover. China was an exception, with the IMF in the latest edition of its Fiscal Monitor published in October having estimated that the public fiscal balance has increased, in line with slowing growth and a continuation of very low inflation. As an exception, several oil and natural gas exporting countries achieved budget surpluses owing to the sharp hikes in commodity prices across much of the year. Similarly, the IMF has also estimated that in global terms, the level of public debt has remained above $90 \%$ of GDP (more than $100 \%$ for the third consecutive year in the case of the developed economies) and around 7.5 percentage points higher than before the pandemic.

Economic expansion has continued to fuel fresh demand for labour in most sectors of activity. Supply, on the other hand, has also been quick to respond, although the labour market participation rate in the case of developed economies, has remained at lower levels than before the pandemic. This has, accordingly, prolonged the imbalance between demand and supply, which has, on the one hand, contributed to further reductions in unemployment levels and, on the other, to an increase of pressure on wages, with the respective income, both in industry and in services, continuing to trend to pre-pandemic values. Notwithstanding the above, the fact that nominal wage growth has not fully kept pace with inflation, has, in

several regions, entailed a sharp contraction of real growth that has particularly affected purchasing power and the well-being of households with more limited resources.

Economic activity, in 2022, remained conditioned by other risk areas, several of which arising in the previous year. This, once again, particularly included difficulties in goods production and supply chains, albeit decreasing, not only related to final consumer goods, but also to intermediate goods used in production processes.

A new focus of risk, as the main economic issue of 2022, was the beginning of the monetary policy normalisation process comprising the withdrawal of monetary stimuli in developed economies, which had remained in place at the beginning of the year, owing to the significant acceleration in terms of the growth of prices. With a decrease in inflation considered to be fundamental for the recovery of household purchasing power, investors and analysts consider that the triggering of the referred to process has made an inevitable and considerable contribution to the increasing short term likelihood of a recession across the year as a whole, both in the US and in Europe.

# European Central Bank 

The ECB adopted several measures to make monetary policy less expansionary, in 2022, gradually accelerating the rate of normalisation of monetary conditions across the year on the basis of inflation levels that had not been observed since 1992. Such measures particularly included the first key interest rate increase since 2011. In less than six months, the central bank announced a cumulative increase of 250 bps in interest rates that, in previous rate increase cycles, took at least eighteen months to implement. At the end of the year, the marginal lending facility, the main refinancing operations and the deposit facility rates were set at $2.75 \%, 2.50 \%$ and $2.00 \%$, respectively.

As regards the quantitative easing programmes still in place, the ECB also took decisions to reverse accommodative monetary policy guidelines. In March, it closed the PEPP - Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme and although, in the same month, announcing a monthly reduction schedule for the rate of securities purchases under the APP - Asset Purchase Programme, three months later the governing council decided to terminate all net acquisitions from the beginning of the second half year. Also as regards this programme, during the governing council meeting in December, the ECB announced that from March 2023, its size would begin to decrease based on the non-reinvestment of the principal on outstanding bonds. At the end of last year, the central bank anticipated an average decrease of $€ 15$ billion per month up until the end of second quarter 2023, from which time the subsequent rate would be reviewed in line with market conditions.

In October, with the aim of bringing the remuneration on the mandatory minimum reserve requirements held by credit institutions with the Eurosystem more into line with money market conditions, the ECB's governing council decided that minimum reserves would be remunerated at the interest rate on the deposit facility instead of the main refinancing rate.

In addition to these decisions, the ECB's governing council has, across the year, been paying greater attention to the effects that monetary policy adjustments, either by reducing the size of its balance sheet or by raising key interest rates, could begin to have, not only on the evolution of yield spreads on sovereign debt between member states, but also on the risks of financial fragmentation in the region.

In this context, the ECB's governing council, in July, formally approved the creation of the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI) precisely owing to the sharp increase in sovereign yield spreads and funding costs at the time, given expectations of short-term increases in base rates. The creation of the TPI was presented as being fundamental for ensuring the effective and uniform transmission of monetary policy across all euro area member countries, with the ECB having stated that it will use this instrument whenever considered necessary to counter disorderly, unjustified and potentially serious dynamics in debt markets based on the acquisition of sovereign bonds or securities issued by public agencies or regional governments. It was decided that the net volume of asset purchases will be based on future risks without any restriction prior to implementation.

Lastly and close to the end of the year, the ECB's governing council also decided to amend the conditions attached to the third series of longer term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) in order to ensure consistency with the broader process of monetary policy normalisation and to restore price stability over the medium term. Starting at the end of November 2022 and up to the maturity or early repayment date of each operation in progress, the interest rate on these operations shall be indexed to the ECB's applicable average base rates during this period.

# Other Central Banks 

With regard to the actions of G4 central banks, the board of governors of the Federal Reserve (Fed) began to adjust monetary policy accommodation levels earlier and more sharply. Reference should be made to a cycle of increases in the Fed Funds rate in 2022, totalling 425 bps, for a range of between $4.25 \%$ - $4.50 \%$ at the end of December, the highest since the end of 2007.

In 2022, the Federal Reserve also initiated an unconventional measures reversal process. The US central bank announced its plan to reduce the amounts of portfolio debt assets in the first few days of May. The members of the board of governors agreed on monthly limits for the non-reinvestment of government treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities (commonly referred to as MBSs) of $\$ 30$ billion and $\$ 17.5$ billion per month, between June and September, latterly admitting an increase of these amounts in the following months to $\$ 60$ billion and $\$ 35$ billion per month. The US central bank's balance sheet which accounted for $37.4 \%$ of GDP at the end of 2021, was down to $33.6 \%$ in December 2022.

Other central banks in developed and emerging economies also made financial conditions less expansionary across 2022. The Bank of England, which had already begun work on a cycle of base rate hikes in December 2021, accelerated the rate of normalisation over the past year in the form of eight base rate increases which were also more significant across the second half of the year in response to the sharp increases in the growth of prices, to 325 bps , with the rate being set at $3.50 \%$ at the end of December. The central bank has also started to reduce the size of its quantitative easing programme after attaining a maximum amount of $£ 895$ billion, in two ways: (i) letting some of their sovereign bonds (Gilts) mature and (ii) disposing off a part of its portfolio securities.

In other developed bloc countries, reference should also be made to the performance of the Bank of Canada which announced seven increases in its policy rate since the beginning of March, from $0.25 \%$ to $4.25 \%$. In the case of Switzerland and notwithstanding considerably lower inflation levels than in other European countries, the central bank announced three increases in its policy rate totalling 175 bps, from $-0.75 \%$ at the end of 2021 to $1.00 \%$ twelve months later.

Already close to year end, reference should be made to the Bank of Japan's decision to double the permitted fluctuation limit for the level of yields on its 10 year sovereign debt securities of $-1+25$ bps to values from then on of between $-0.50 \%$ and $+0.50 \%$ owing to the mismatch at which the different maturities of the yield curve were being negotiated. This decision was understood as being an indication of the possible short-term normalisation of the yield curve control policy.

Also as regards Asia, reference should be made to China in which the maintenance of inflation below the ceiling admitted by the central bank contributed to a divergent monetary policy from that of the other major economies. The Central Bank of China even undertook a further easing of monetary policy over the summer to support the recovery of the economy. The trend over the rest of Asia was, however, one of base rate increases, as attested by the case of India whose central bank increased its respective base rate by an accrued amount of 225 bps to $6.25 \%$ in December.

Eastern Europe, close to the epicentre of the military crisis in Ukraine, also witnessed high price growth, with the various central banks reacting with the same objective of controlling inflation. In the case of the three major economies of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, following highly substantial increases in interest rates across the first half of last year, starting at the end of summer those responsible for conducting monetary policy opted to maintain their central rates. It should be noted, however, that as opposed to their other European peers, there have been rate hikes in either of these three economies since the beginning of second half 2021. In Russia, after several sanctions packages were imposed on the economy by the international community shortly after the start of the conflict in Ukraine and to address the immediate depreciation of both the national currency - rouble - and portfolio financial assets, the central bank initially responded with an aggressive increase in base rate to $20.00 \%$. The subsequent normalisation of exchange rates and favourable evolution of public account and inflation-related indicators led to a progressive easing of monetary conditions, with subsequent reductions to an end-of-year base rate of $7.50 \%$.

In Latin America, reference should be made to the performance of several central banks, including Mexico, Chile, Peru and Brazil. In the latter case, the central bank, which was one of the first to embark upon a monetary policy adjustment phase as early as March 2021 (with a 750 bps increase, in the referred to year) added another 450 bps to its SELIC rate in 2022. As in the case of the main Eastern Europe economies, Brazil's monetary authority suspended the process of increasing its rate from the end of the summer.

In Angola, the National Bank announced a reduction of its BNA rate by 0.50 bps, to $19.50 \%$, in September. This is the first time this has happened since 2019, with the decision having been justified by consistency in terms of price growth moderation. The respective year-on-year change in the price index was from $27.0 \%$

to $13.9 \%$ last December compared to the same month 2021. This is a result of continued and rigorous liquidity control in the economy and particularly an appreciation of the kwanza. Mozambique's central bank, on the other hand, increased the cost of credit operations with a 400 bps hike in its MIMO rate last year (200 bps in March and the same amount in September) setting the rate at $17.25 \%$ at the end of 2022. This was its highest level since April 2018 and was in response to the acceleration of consumer price growth.

# Portuguese economy 

## Global evolution

As in the case of the other euro area countries, the Portuguese economy has been affected by the deteriorating external and financial environment. According to the report on the national accounts for 2022 published by the National Statistics Institute (INE), economic activity grew $6.7 \%$ in 2022, in real terms, following the preceding year's expansion of $5.5 \%$, largely deriving from economic performance in the first quarter of the year, recovery of the tourism and leisure sector and an above historical average annual growth rate of the European economy. The year 2022 also witnessed the return of GDP to a level higher than before the outbreak of the pandemic.

Reference should also be made to the resilience of private consumption, deriving from the accumulation of savings during the Covid-19 crisis, the making of delayed purchases and government support measures, which were primarily targeted at fringes of the population with lower income levels. According to the INE, private consumption which accounts for the largest proportion of the demand component was up $5.7 \%$ in 2022. This was offset by the slower rate of growth of gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) in this case $2.7 \%$, in comparison to $8.7 \%$ in 2021. This slowdown was linked to a context of constraints on supply capacity, higher production costs and worsening financing conditions deriving from the ongoing monetary policy normalisation process, as elements less conducive to investment decisions.

(a) Contribution to GDP growth (percentage points).

In terms of foreign trade, exports remained dynamic, with the INE forecasting annual growth of $16.7 \%$, mainly fuelled by exports of services ( $37.7 \%$, in comparison to $19.6 \%$ in 2021) and in which the tourism-related component was up $80 \%$ in 2022. Imports were up $11.0 \%$, in comparison to the preceding year's $13.2 \%$. Reference should be made, herein, to moderating goods imports with a $13.2 \%$ to $11.0 \%$ growth rate from one year to the next owing to the goods component

As regards the foreign trade balance and in this case also according to the Bank of Portugal's estimate as published in its Economic Bulletin of March 2023, the Portuguese economy is expected to require external financing of $0.4 \%$ of GDP owing to the more negative contribution of the balance of goods, as a reflection of the deterioration of the terms of trade and reduction of the surplus on the income and capital accounts, which was only partly offset by a larger surplus on the balance of services owing to the recovery of tourism-related flows and revenues.

According to the INE, the general government deficit stood at $0.4 \%$ of GDP in 2022. This was lower than the estimate of $1.9 \%$ published in the 2023 state budget, resulting in a 2.5 pp improvement of GDP over 2021 $(2.9 \%)$. The combined effect of the decrease in the proportion of total expenditure in terms of GDP ( -3 pp of

GDP) which was greater than the decrease in the proportion of total revenue ( -0.5 pp of GDP) contributed to the improvement of the fiscal balance.

On the other hand, the public debt ratio of $113.9 \%$ of GDP was 11.5 pp down over the previous year, mainly on account of the $11.4 \%$ contribution of nominal GDP growth.

According to Eurostat, the harmonised index of consumer prices grew by an annual $8.1 \%$ in 2022, to its highest level since 1993, in comparison to $0.9 \%$ in 2021. A large part of this change derived from the contribution of energy and unprocessed food items, with year-on-year changes of $23.6 \%$ and $12.2 \%$, respectively. Notwithstanding, there was also a considerable increase in the remaining accounts included in the price basket, with underlying inflation up $4.9 \%$ in the year. Although several signs of an easing of inflationary pressures were noted across the second half of the year, levels remained very high across 2022.

In terms of the labour market, according to information on the employment statistics disclosed by the INE, in a context of labour supply shortages and economic recovery, there was a $2.0 \%$ increase in the number of employees in comparison to the previous year, and $1.9 \%$ in comparison to 2021. The unemployment rate continued to decline to a historically low level from $6.6 \%$ to $6.0 \%$.

# Deposits and credit 

At the end of 2023, the M3 liquidity aggregate (which, in addition to banknotes and coins, bank reserves, on-demand and fixed-term bank deposits and government bonds held by the public), excluding currency in circulation, grew $7.5 \%$, down 4.2 pp over the same period 2021. In the same month, total deposits registered a year-on-year change of $5.8 \%$, in comparison to $4.7 \%$ in 2021 . There was a change in the growth of the deposits of individuals and emigrants, from $6.8 \%$ to $5.5 \%$. Following a first period during which there was a higher rate of accumulation, related to the increase in uncertainty and higher household savings levels, the second half year witnessed moderation in the rate of deposit growth owing to inflationary pressures on real disposable household income. Growth in the deposits of non-financial corporations decelerated across the year by 9.1 pp to $8.9 \%$.

In terms of lending, total domestic credit registered a year-on-year change of $2.3 \%$ in December. This was less positive than the $3.9 \%$ of 2021 , largely owing to the decrease in lending to personal customers. Reference should be made to the mortgage segment, with an expansion of $3.1 \%$, in comparison to the preceding year's $4.1 \%$. The credit for consumption and other purposes account accelerated by 0.7 pp in comparison to $2.3 \%$ in 2021. In terms of credit to non-financial corporations, companies continued to trend towards reducing their indebtedness as noted in 2021. Growth in lending to corporates was down from 4.5\% to $0.1 \%$ in 2022. Loans to local and central and local government contracted by $2.7 \%$ ( $2.1 \%$ in 2021).

## Interest rates

The European Central Bank's monetary policy in 2022 was strongly conditioned by the high levels of inflation in the euro area and in the rest of the world. Despite the slowdown in economic activity, accelerating inflation required a significant tightening of financial conditions in the form of base rate increases and the beginning of the reversal of quantitative easing programmes.

## EURIBOR

(\%)
![img-11.jpeg](img-11.jpeg)

Short-term interest rates, in 2022, registered the most significant annual increases since the creation of Economic and Monetary Union, in a year in which the governing council of the ECB decided on a cumulative 250 bps increase in its base rates over a period of only six months. Notwithstanding the existence of a certain intra-annual change and starting 2022 with low levels of volatility, the profile of short-term interest rates across the year was one of a practically constant increase based both on investors' economic considerations regarding inflation and the ECB's highly aggressive discourse regarding the future direction of monetary policy. The euro short term rate (€STR) has always remained at a level of around 10 bps less than the deposit facility rate and ended the year at $1.89 \%$. Euribor interest rates were up between 248 bps for the 1 month rate ( $1.88 \%$ ) and 279 bps for the 12 month rate ( $3.29 \%$ ). In the case of 3 month and 6 month rates, the levels of $2.18 \%$ and $2.73 \%$ resulted from changes of 275 and 327 bps.

In Portugal, given the nature of Euribor rates as a benchmark for the credit operations of euro area banks, interest rates charged on new operations naturally kept pace with the trend on these benchmarks. The increase in the case of mortgage loans, was significant and constant, up from a level of $0.83 \%$ in 2021 to $3.24 \%$ in 2022, as opposed to operations with non-financial corporations in which it was up by 252 bps to $4.42 \%$. Movements in terms of borrowing rates, were more marginal for the term deposits of personal customers (up 2 bps), contrasting with the rate for non-financial corporations (up 53 bps ) of $0.08 \%$ and $0.58 \%$, respectively.

## Foreign exchange markets

In foreign exchange markets, reference should, once again, be made to the US dollar in 2022. The US currency continued to trend to appreciation across much of the year, in a movement starting as early as the preceding June. The dollar benefited, on the one hand, from greater economic and financial uncertainty and on the other, from the Federal Reserve's more aggressive approach in terms of adapting higher levels of monetary restrictiveness compared to other central banks in developed economies.

The effective dollar (evolution in relation to a broad basket of currencies), which, in September, was up $19.3 \%$ since the start of the year, ended 2022 with an appreciation of $8.2 \%$. This trend reversal also derives from a series of larger increases in base rates by other central banks, particularly the ECB and the Bank of England in the case of Europe. The bilateral change against the euro was $5.8 \%$, in comparison to $7.4 \%$ in 2021, with the foreign exchange cross closing 2022 at $\$ 1.07$ to the euro. Reference should, notwithstanding, be made to the period between the end of August and the beginning of November during which the euro remained for much of the time below parity against the dollar, for the first time since 2002. In contrast to the dollar's appreciation, the effective euro depreciated by a marginal $0.4 \%$, in comparison to around $5.0 \%$ in the preceding year. This performance is explained by the ECB's continued adoption of an accommodative discourse in the first half year, when it had failed to demonstrate a firm conviction to reverse broad monetary stimuli despite the acceleration of inflation beyond the accepted limit.

Sterling, which in 2021 had appreciated $6.3 \%$ against the euro, was down $5.0 \%$ in 2022, ending the year at $€ 1.13 / \mathrm{E}$. The fall against the US dollar was more substantial than against the euro, in this case $10.7 \%$, in a

year in which the UK economy came under strong political and economic pressure, owing to the prevalence of fears of a deeper recession than in other developed economies across much of the year.

The yen was down against the dollar in 2022 for the second consecutive year, by two digits: $13.9 \%$, in comparison to the preceding year's $10.3 \%$. As in 2021, the Bank of Japan's monetary policy divergence was a decisive factor in investors' preference for other currencies, in addition to the fact that the economy once again disappointed, with consecutive negative first and second quarter growth levels.

With regard to the currencies of emerging economies, the appreciation of the US dollar and increase in government bond yields once again led to the weakening of China's yuan ( $8.5 \%$ ) and of most emerging currencies, particularly India's rupee ( $11.3 \%$ ) as well as a loss of more than $40 \%$ by Turkey's lira. On the contrary, the US currency lost ground against Brazil's real ( $-5.1 \%$ ) and Russia's rouble. Despite the sharp fall in the value of Russia's currency after the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine, which, in the first week of March was $67 \%$, the decisive action of the central bank, which substantially increased its base rate, and the measures taken by the authorities to prevent the negative effects of sanctions led the currency to achieve a strong subsequent recovery, ending 2022 with a marginal gain of $1.3 \%$ against the dollar and $7.3 \%$ against the euro.

Angola's kwanza (Kz) appreciated for the second consecutive year against the euro and the dollar, in 2022, up $13.9 \%$ and $8.4 \%$, respectively, to Kz $544.6 / €$ and Kz $509.3 / \$$. The appreciation of the currency benefited from higher oil prices (with Brent up $9.7 \%$ across the year), as well as the loans and international financial aid that continued to boost the supply of foreign currency.

Notwithstanding the highly substantial gains achieved in 2021, Mozambique's metical once again appreciated against both euro and dollar, this time by $6.0 \%$ and $0.4 \%$, respectively, to MT $68.3 / €$ and MT $63.4 / \$$, respectively at end December. The improvement in the economic environment, with an acceleration of the growth of activity and 400 bps increase in base rate were the fundamental factors behind the maintenance of foreign exchange stability together with the lifting of restrictive measures related to the pandemic from summer onwards.

## Capital markets

The substantial increase in inflation and consequent significant tightening of financial conditions by the central banks and the outbreak of armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia, which was one of the events, if not the event, with the greatest global impact, were factors that made 2022 one of the worst years in history for bonds and a very unfavourable year for corporate shares. The bond market was down by more than $15 \%$, whereas the European and US stock markets recorded double-digit losses. In addition, 2022 was a year in which almost all assets, not only bonds and shares, were penalised in sync with a relatively rare occurrence.

The economic context in financial markets was notoriously peculiar. Global growth of slightly more than 3 pp was only a little below the average of the pre-pandemic years. Global inflation, however, surpassed a surprising threshold of 8 pp in the year, to levels higher than at any other time over the past three decades in several economies. A combination between mediocre growth and record inflation comprised a constant

fear among investors over the short-term possibility of a period of stagflation, an occurrence rarely witnessed since the 1970s.

Investors have accordingly become increasingly apprehensive across the year, particularly since March, as a result of the outbreak of war in Ukraine and after the US Federal Reserve admitted the possibility that higher inflation levels might not, after all, be transitory as opposed to what had been previously stated. Stock and bond indices were down while the US dollar appreciated significantly in the ensuing months as the cycle of rising interest rates could prove to be longer and more aggressive. The euro, in turn, embarked upon a downwards trend, with the ECB in the following months showing reluctance to at least signal the beginning of a period of base rate adjustments. The year 2022 was also marked by a highly significant correction of the crypto currency market, pursuant to which reference should be made, in November, to the bankruptcy of FTX, one of the largest companies trading in these assets.

With a high level of geopolitical uncertainty and high inflation rates together with interest rates as the main constraints on the evolution of financial markets in 2022, Covid-19 infections have not ceased to be a factor on the list of investors' main concerns. The impact was particularly felt in China, whose authorities imposed significant constraints on the total opening of the economy across a significant part of the year owing to its Covid-zero policy which naturally affected the rate of economic expansion.

# Stock Markets 

A large part of 2022 was pervaded by a highly pessimistic climate that led most stock market indices to record their first annual depreciation in four years. Globally, 2022 was the worst year since the worldwide financial crisis of 2008, in which the MSCI international equity index lost around a fifth of its value. This was the worst result in fourteen years, i.e. since the global financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 wiped out $40 \%$ of the respective index. Breaking with historical norms, the US S\&P 500 recorded a much larger number of days of losses than gains.

Persistent and far higher than expected inflation and aggressive increases in base rates by the major central banks in developed bloc economies had a negative impact on investor sentiment and valuations across the year as a whole, having particularly affected growth stocks (i.e. companies considered as having the potential to achieve above average profits and outperforming the sector in which they operate or even the market as a whole) and technology stocks, in this case with several big techs depreciating by more than $50 \%$. Geopolitical concerns and the publication of underperforming economic data heightened fears of a global recession and further added to a very negative year in the main financial markets.

The top three US indices made the most significant losses since 2008. Special reference should be made to the NASDAQ, with a third of its value (down $33.1 \%$ ) wiping out the gains of the previous two years, followed by the Russell2000 (down 21.6\%) and the S\&P 500 (down 19.4\%), while in the case of the Dow Jones the loss, although equally significant, was lower (only $8.8 \%$ ). Despite the decline and continued uncertainty and the risks identified, stock market volatility remained at a level in line with that recorded during the Asian crisis at the end of the last century and the recession associated with the dot.com crisis at the beginning of this century, although lower than the levels recorded during the great recession of 2008-09, during the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and the first months of the Covid-19 pandemic.

In terms of European indices, the Eurostoxx600 closed 2022 down 12.9\%, to a minimum of the last two years near the end of the third quarter. The falls were led by the Italian ( $-13.3 \%$ ) and German ( $-12.3 \%$ ) stock markets, while France's CAC recorded a slightly lower annual depreciation of $9.5 \%$. There were exceptions in Europe, particularly in the case of the UK's Footsie ( $0.9 \%$ ) and Portugal's PSI20, which appreciated 2.8\% following gains of $13.7 \%$ in 2021.

Also as regards Europe and in sectoral terms, reference should be made to the fact that depreciation was recorded across almost all sectors, in 2022 and which, in several cases, reached double-digit percentages. Particular reference should be made to real estate ( $-40.1 \%$ ), together with technology ( $-28.4 \%$ ) and financial services ( $-25.2 \%$ ). The exceptions were related to the nature of the crisis, as only the natural resources sector ( $4.3 \%$ ) and, above all, energy ( $24.4 \%$ ) posted appreciation. The banking and insurance sectors, were down $3.2 \%$ and $1.0 \%$, respectively and less serious than those recorded in the general index.

In emerging markets, the respective Morgan Stanley index was down $22.4 \%$ (-23.4\% in the case of the BRIC region), particularly on account of Hong Kong's Hang Seng (-15.5\%) and China's Shanghai 300 (-15.1\%) indices as opposed to Brazil's Ibovespa and India's Sensex which were up $4.7 \%$ and $4.4 \%$, respectively.

Japan's Nikkei225 and Topix stock indices ended 2022 with annual losses of $20.3 \%$ and $16.5 \%$.

# Bond Markets 

In terms of the evolution of financial markets by asset class, reference should be made, in 2022, to the bonds and particularly the sovereign bonds segment. These securities, whose changes are usually more contained, have suffered the sharpest depreciation since at least 1977 owing to the escalation of inflation that forced central banks to announce an increase in their base rates at the fastest and most aggressive rate in at least 40 years. In practice, at the beginning of the second half year, the monetary authorities opted to announce aggressive increases of 75 bps in the case of the main central banks instead of the traditional increments of 25 bps in order to bring central bank interest rates close to or in line with a level considered restrictive as soon as possible.

Central banks worldwide announced nearly 300 increases in base rates across 2022, totalling more than a 25 bps rise per session. Although the Bank of Japan was isolated in this process, it was the only monetary authority in developed economies not to change its respective central rate, close to the end of the year and did not fail to surprise investors when it doubled the ceiling for the level of yields on 10 year sovereign bonds, in a decision interpreted to be a sign of the possible short term normalisation of the yield curve policy control. The US Federal Reserve increased its Fed funds rate by 400 basis points, including four increases of 75 bps, whereas in the euro area the ECB embarked upon its monetary policy adjustment process at a later stage, with a 250 points interest rate hike in the space of half a year. The change, in the case of the deposit facility rate was from $-0.50 \%$ in July to $2.00 \%$ at the end of the year.

In 2022 the fixed-income bond market was also marked by the beginning of the implementation of the reversal of unconventional monetary policies from 2007, to complement the main operating measure. In this specific context, both in the case of the US and Europe, reference should be made to the start of the process of reducing the amount of debt securities acquired by central banks in recent years in order to ensure that their funding costs would remain at historically low levels.

The yield on government bonds in the main European countries and in the US experienced a second consecutive annual increase, which was, this time, much more significant than in the previous year and not only in the case of longer but also in the case of shorter maturities.

German and French debt securities which are usually selected as safe haven assets for investors did not benefit from this status in 2022. Yields on long-term sovereign bonds were up across all maturities. Tenyear bonds witnessed changes of 275 bps and 292 bps, against 39.2 bps and 53.6 bps in 2021, closing at $2.57 \%$ and $3.12 \%$, respectively. The levels at the end of December were not only the highest in the year but the highest in around 11 years. Movements in 2 -year bonds were further marked by ECB activity, with German and French yields rising 338 bps and 357 bps respectively.

Yields on Italian debt and the so-called countries on the European periphery also closed 2022 at levels well above those observed at the end of 2021. The series of decisions made by the ECB had, unsurprisingly, a greater impact on these countries as a whole, with annual increases in excess of 300 bps. Particular reference should be made to Italy ( 353 bps ) closely followed by Greece ( 329 bps ), with their respective yields of more than 4 pp . In the case of Spain ( 310 bps ), the end of year rate of $3.66 \%$, was the highest since the first weeks of 2014.

The yield on Portugal's 10 year public debt also increased considerably in 2022, in this case by 312 bps, closing at $3.59 \%$, its highest since second quarter 2017. The respective yield on 2 -year maturities rose 345 bps to $2.80 \%$. The spread between the Portuguese and German 10 year yield, in 2022, widened for the second consecutive year from 37.3 bps to 101.5 bps. Compared to Spain, the change was practically zero at only -2 bps , with a difference of no more than 8 bps at the end of the year. The slope of the Portuguese

curve between 10 years and 2 years decreased 33 bps, to 79 bps, in an almost full reversal of the 2021 increment.

US yields also increased sharply over the whole of the yield curve. This movement was slightly lower than that of its European counterparts in the case of longer maturity rates and marginally higher in the case of shorter maturities, owing to a more proactive approach by the Federal Reserve with regard to the monetary policy adjustment rate. The yield on 10-year sovereign bonds was up 237 bps to $3.87 \%$ at slightly below 4 pp, which was superseded between October and November. As in the case of the peripheral economies, the largest increase was in the yields of the shorter maturities, as was the case of the 2-year yield ( 369 bps to $4.43 \%$ ). The slope between 10-year maturities and this period was accordingly significantly down by 133 pp.

Reference should also be made to the evolution of the UK's sovereign bond market. Gilts with the same maturity were up 270 bps to $3.67 \%$. Despite their high level, the rate of $4.50 \%$ reached at the beginning of October was the highest since the bankruptcy of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, As a result of the decision of the recently inaugurated government led by Liz Truss to advance with plans for a highly expansionary fiscal policy, which clashed with the endeavours of the Bank of England (BoE) to contain inflation.

In the case of Japan and after the 10 year sovereign debt yield remained at its upper limit of the range admitted by the central bank as part of its income curve control policy, the already referred to decision to extend the band's variation from $+/-0.25 \%$ to $+/-0.50 \%$ on 20 December immediately led to the yield on securities traded on the secondary market to be fixed at around 0.50 pp . The yield on the referred to maturity rose 35 bps across the year, ending at a five year high of $0.42 \%$.

The emerging bloc witnessed smaller increases than those observed in the case of better quality issuers, as a consequence of a less aggressive increase in base rates. It should be noted that the central banks in these regions had already implemented a relevant part of their adjustments to financial conditions across 2021. Changes in 10-year sovereign bond yields in the case of Russia and Brazil were practically the same at 187 bps and 185 bps. China's yield remained virtually unchanged owing to the near inactivity of the Central Bank of China in terms of defining new central rates.

Uncertainty over the evolution of the economy, tightening financial conditions and geopolitical risks were contributory factors to an increase in CDSs (credit default swaps) in 2022. The indices, which until the outbreak of the military conflict in Ukraine remained close to their historical lows, increased sharply.

There were significant changes in spreads in the European credit default swaps (CDS) market which were up 47.8 bps to 90.6 bps in 2022. It should be noted that the spread had risen to 139 bps near the end of the third quarter. This was, at the time, the highest recorded since the first weeks of the pandemic and, before that, since the end of 2012. There was also an increase in spread in the financial sector, as in the generic index, in this case 44.4 bps , to end the year at 99.3 bps . Both indicators, at the beginning of the year were close to the values witnessed immediately prior to the pandemic.

In the case of Germany, the maximum value recorded in the year, during the month of October, supplanted what was attained during the first weeks of the pandemic. German CDSs were up from 9.9 bps to 18.9 bps at the end of 2022, which in terms of annual close, were their highest since 2019. In the case of Portugal, the annual increase in the respective CDSs was from 23.4 bps to 54.7 bps at the end of December, in this case the highest in four years.

# Portuguese banking system 

## Global evolution

The domestic banking system remained strong in 2022, notwithstanding all the challenges and uncertainties inherent to the changes in the socio-economic context prevailing until then, with the outbreak of war and price increases, giving rise to prospects of deterioration in economic activity. However, this was accompanied, in parallel, by lessening uncertainty related to the pandemic's potential effects, which enabled a certain recovery of confidence by the national private sector, albeit affected by rising inflation and monetary policy normalisation. After the end of the extraordinary support measures, initial fears of a certain increase in defaults both by personal customers and the sectors most affected by the pandemic, particularly those more directly related to tourism and leisure, tended to disappear with domestic banks having evidenced stable levels of liquidity and capital and efficient management of their assets.

The adjustment of monetary policy to mitigate high and persistent price hikes had several effects on the improvement of domestic banks' net interest income which, allied to the reversal of provisions and

impairment registered over the pandemic period, led to an increase in the average profitability of domestic credit institutions. The positive evolution of bank profitability was also the result of an improvement in their operational efficiency based on the progressive implementation of optimisation and digital transformation processes over the years and again in 2022. At the same time and allied to the lessening of uncertainty over the potential effects of the pandemic, there was an average level of expansion of domestic banks' assets. Higher lending levels without the occurrence of marked debt servicing difficulties by households and domestic business operatives, helped to expand the endogenous generation of capital that will potentially mitigate domestic institutions' future funding risks in wholesale markets. This is all the more important in a context of rising interest rates and the need to meet the final MREL (minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities) targets.

Reference should be made to the funding of institutions, as bank deposits continued their markedly positive growth trend initiated in the pandemic, accompanied by a significant decrease in funding from central banks. Liquidity indicators recorded very high levels, as has been the case in the domestic banking system across recent years.

# Asset quality 

For several years, domestic banks have continued to trend to a reduction of their non-performing assets. The NPL ratio of Portuguese credit institutions has, accordingly, also continued to decrease on the basis of higher lending. This increase, however, occurred at a faster pace up to the end of the second quarter. The slowdown in the amount of lending in the second half of the year was possibly related to the start of the ECB's implementation of its monetary policy normalisation process in July 2022 which signalled the first direct base rate hike in Euro Area in eleven years. Together with mortgage lending, some of the reasons for the lower demand for credit in the second half of the year were related to lower levels of consumer confidence and less optimistic expectations over the evolution of prices in the housing market.

2022 was a landmark year for the disposal of non-core assets, in particular restructuring funds. The resolution of the so-called Crow Project, jointly launched by several banks in the Portuguese banking system, led to the sale of the stake in certain funds, which allowed for a significant reduction in exposure to this type of asset.

In the current economic environment, there is evidence of a greater possibility of a fresh materialisation of credit and market risk affecting domestic banks, either through increases of non-performing assets or depreciation of investment portfolios, particularly public debt securities. However, following (i) the increased implementation of the action plan for the risk of default (PARI) and the out-of-court default settlement procedure (PERSI) in August 2021; (ii) the reformulation, in April 2022, of the Bank of Portugal's macroprudential recommendation on new mortgage loans which reduced the maximum maturity of new mortgage credit operations, depending on a borrower's age; (iii) and the implementation of additional oversight measures and mitigation of the increase in the debt-to-income ratio (i.e. affordability) for mortgage credit agreements through decree law 80-A/2022 of 25 November, domestic banks now enjoy a solid regulatory framework that will enable the banks to provide customers with proactive solutions to enable them to service their debts and anticipate the possibility of defaults.

In December 2022 the NPL ratio stood at $3.0 \%$, down 0.7 pp over the end of the previous year, reflecting domestic institutions' endeavours in terms of prudent asset management. In turn, the ratio of NPLs net of impairments was down 0.4 p.p. compared to December 2021 to $1.3 \%$, while the NPLs coverage ratio showed an upward trajectory from the second quarter, having reached $55.4 \%$ at the end of the year, up 2.9 p.p. compared to the same period. It should also be noted that, in 2022, the sharpest decrease in NPL ratios occurred in loans to non-financial corporations (down 1.6 p.p. compared to 2021), due to the improvements in economic activity verified after the lifting of restrictions related to the pandemic.

# Profitability 

At the end of December 2022, the return on assets (ROA) of the Portuguese banking system stood at $0.7 \%$, which represents an increase of 20 bps compared to the end of the previous year. This evolution benefited, above all, from the growth in operating income and the reduction in provisions and impairments. Compared to the end of 2021, the growth in operating income was largely due to the improvement in the net interest income, despite the negative pressure exerted by the increase in operating costs. It should be noted that net interest income benefited from the high weight of assets indexed, usually, to interbank interest rates, which increased in line with the increases registered in the key interest rates.

Given the improvement in banking income, which more than offset the increase in operating costs, the cost-to-income ratio decreased by 3.0 p.p. compared to the previous year, standing at $50.4 \%$. It should also be noted that, during the third quarter of the year, a new low ( $49.9 \%$ ) was reached since the current quarterly series of data was made available (2008). Considering annual data, there was also a slight reduction in the cost of credit risk ( -4 bp compared to the same period last year, to $0.29 \%$ ).

As for the return on equity (ROE) of the Portuguese banking system, it stood at $8.8 \%$ in the fourth quarter of 2022, i.e. an increase of 3.4 p.p. compared to the end of 2021, also being one of the highest values since 2009.

# Solvency 

In 2022, the total equity ratio increased by 0.1 p.p. compared to the end of 2021, to $18.1 \%$. The increase in the Tier 2 capital ratio ( +0.3 p.p.) contributed to this evolution, which more than offset the decline in the Tier 1 capital ratio ( -0.2 p.p.), while the ratio additional Tier 1 equity capital remained unchanged. The rise in the total own funds ratio essentially reflected the reduction in the total amount of exposures at risk.

## Liquidity and Funding

Among the actions that materialize the normalization of monetary policy, the ECB decided, in October 2022, to change the conditions of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III). Despite this modification, and despite the fact that there was a decrease in the main liquidity indicators of Portuguese banks during 2022, Portuguese institutions remained with a solid liquidity position. Thus, at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, the weight of funding obtained from central banks in total liabilities and equity of the Portuguese banking system decreased considerably compared to the same period of the previous year, having gone from $9.4 \%$ to $3.6 \%$. Together, highly liquid assets accounted for $25.2 \%$ of the system's average total assets, i.e. a decrease of 2 p.p. compared to the value at the end of 2021. Finally, the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) decreased by around 31 p.p. between the fourth quarter of 2021 and the fourth quarter of 2022, still standing at a very high level ( $229.2 \%$ ) and above the respective regulatory requirement $(100 \%)$.

In 2022, there continued to be a preponderance of dependence on funding by banks in the Portuguese system on customer deposits. Until the third quarter of 2022, the weight of customer deposits in total liabilities and capital remained practically unchanged, around, but below $70 \%$. Furthermore, at the end of last year, there was a more pronounced quarterly rise in this ratio, standing at $73.1 \%$, i.e. an increase of 4 p.p. compared to the previous quarter and 4.7 p.p. compared to the same quarter.

Notwithstanding an increase in risk premia demanded by investors and market interest rates across the year, as a result of deteriorating expectations over economic activity, several Portuguese banking institutions issued debt eligible for the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) to provide for any changes in yields demanded by international financial markets pursuant to the current upwards trend in interest rates.

## Banking sector challenges

The challenges facing the domestic banking sector involve two aspects: these are firstly aspects of a structural nature, following the emergence of economic and technological developments over recent decades, and, secondly they are related to the unusual context, characterised by the occurrence of sudden and highly infrequent events across the recent period.

The structural issues facing financial institutions are part of a long journey they have been undertaking towards providing customers with a fast, secure and efficient service. This evolution and sophistication in terms of banking has been enabled by the digitalisation process backed by new technologies and current trends, which, in addition to improving the efficiency of internal processes, will represent one of the necessary steps in terms of the indispensable effort towards achieving a sustainable economy. The journey, however, brings with it several other contingencies. On the one hand, digital transformation requires major investment, not only financial but also in terms of human capital, which disrupts the dynamics of more

rigorous cost control needed to achieve higher profitability to meet the requirements of investors regarding their perception of remuneration in line with the risk of the investment and its cost of capital. On the other hand, entry into a space that has been operated by new financial system actors, with a certain degree of complexity and flexibility in terms of new technologies and with lower structural and regulatory costs, entails the need for a redoubling of endeavours to provide services that are competitive but which also make it possible to continue to merit the trust of bank customers. In parallel, the risks involved in a changeover to a format with less face-to-face contact, i.e. risks involving cyber and money laundering and countering the financing of terrorist activities, especially in terms of innovation and the adapting of the established technological security systems, require special attention.

This trend towards a more digital society has, in turn, been accompanied, by the greater use of digital assets on a daily basis. In addition to the stability of the financial and payments system, the issuance of digital currencies by central banks has been a common approach to resolving the eventual issue of monetary sovereignty in the euro area deriving from the increased use of crypto assets. As such, there is a possibility of transforming the current way in which financial brokerage activities are performed and, consequently, the sector's capacity to generate profitability.

As regards changes in the economic and geopolitical context, a conjunction of the extraordinary pandemic situation with its major impacts on the distribution chain and delays in goods deliveries, with a sharp recovery of private consumption following multiple economic stimuli has led to a framework capable of fuelling acrossthe-board growth in prices and consequently leading to interest rate hikes. In particular in the case of debtors in the greatest distress, either as a result of their activity being linked to sectors more affected by the pandemic or their greater exposure to rising interest rates or high levels of leverage, creates the potential for an increase in credit risk and consequent default, potentially minimising the ability to achieve returns and therefore future lending which will be reflected in investment and economic growth. The scenario of deteriorating economic activity and increasing uncertainty leads to apprehension over the possible revaluation of asset prices, with a potentially penalising effect on both the asset portfolios of credit institutions and their future financing costs in the market. In this sense, it may prove to be more expensive to issue the capital instruments to fulfil the minimum capital and eligible liabilities requirements (MREL), particularly those that are necessary for compliance with the final requirement up to 1 January 2024.

The challenges facing the domestic banking sector deriving from contextual changes of a regulatory nature, particularly include the necessary completion of the crisis management framework and eventual completion of the third Banking Union pillar (EDIS - European Deposit Insurance Scheme). Although the first circumstantial change will enable a more robust European system, it could also promote greater crossborder capital movements, enhancing M\&As between banking institutions. On the other hand, the European Deposit Insurance System (EDIS), in addition to mitigating the pernicious continuation of ties between sovereign entities and banks, will enable banking sector depositors to enjoy greater stability and promote the system's financial stability although this may translate into additional costs for the banking sector.

Reference should, lastly, be made to the change in the regulatory and supervisory framework applicable to banks on ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) risks that will require greater endeavours, not only regarding the adequacy of internal activities and provision of diverse services and assets to the community in a manner consistent with the objective of achieving a more sustainable economy, but also an increase in reputational risk in terms of the disclosure of information on this matter.

# 1.4.2. Activity: Strategic plan 

## Strategic Plan 2021 - 2024: Building the future

With the beginning of a new mandate at the end of 2021, the formal approval of the 2021-24 Strategic Plan by CGD's new Board of Directors took place in January 2022, following a series of presentation and debate sessions on the Plan's strategic options and initiatives.

After the results achieved in the financial strength, effective risk management and the consolidation of governance mechanisms and internal control, CGD started a new cycle with the Strategic Plan 2021-2024, under the motto "Building the future".

With the Strategic Plan 2021-2024, CGD proposes to:

- Serving the financial needs of Portuguese families and companies, being present in their daily lives and supporting their medium-long-term projects, with particular emphasis on sustainability;

- Commit to excellence and simplicity in customer service, innovative solutions and a complete value proposition;
- Pursue a business model aligned with the best practices in terms of profitability and environmental, social and governance sustainability, consolidating the leadership position in banking in Portugal.

CGD's ambition for 2024, materialized in the new Plan, is based on 6 pillars of transformation:
![img-16.jpeg](img-16.jpeg)

Quality of service and innovation: development of formulas to ensure customer service excellence, exploiting technological innovation and providing a range of user-friendly, highly accessible, robust solutions based on profound knowledge of our customers:

# Evolution of the strategic plan execution 

The implementation of the 2021-24 Strategic Plan began in 2021, with robust results having been achieved, not only through the solid starting point created by the previous strategic plan, but also from the progress achieved in strategic areas as a result of the materialization of initiatives foreseen in the new Plan.

2022 was marked by improved results, particularly comprising increased returns on deposits and the credit portfolio with the end of a cycle of negative rates. Reference should be made to the consolidation of Caixa's performance in terms of ROE and cost-to-income, based on levels of efficiency, asset quality and solvency in line with European banking benchmark operations.

Reference should be made to the adoption of a flexible modus operandi across various areas of the organisation focusing on concrete business objectives with a significant impact on the growth of digital consumer credit sales that accounted for around $45 \%$ in December 2022 and the launch of new insurance sales campaigns for retail customers.

An across-the-board review of customer service models was carried out in 2022, strengthening the oversight of account managers, leveraging the remote management network and launching a dedicated private banking unit. These changes were accompanied by new transactional support solutions with a view to their expansion in future years.

Several campaigns, differentiated in terms of both product and price, were launched for SMEs, using advanced analysis models and investing in the automating of credit decisions for more mass, standardised products.

Caixa launched two new green bond issuances following its inaugural issuance of a sustainable bond in 2021 and is currently engaged on several sustainable and inclusive funding initiatives, particularly in its development of financial products and services for households and businesses in energy transition, efficient buildings and sustainable mobility and it has strengthened the importance of ESG ratings in terms of the lending process and its approach to customers.

As a benchmark operator in terms of ESG practice, greater emphasis has been placed on initiatives to promote equality, diversity and financial and digital inclusion based on inclusive digital solutions such as Caixa's digital assistant and participation in programmes such as "I am Digital".

# 1.4.3. Main risks and uncertainties in 2023 

## Economic framework

The year 2022 witnessed a slowdown in the growth of the global economy that, according to the IMF recorded a rate of expansion of less than 3 pp . Following strong recovery in 2021, largely owing to the easing of restrictions and blockages affecting activity in almost all countries, last year was particularly marked by strong inflationary pressures. Central banks responded to accelerating price growth through a considerable tightening of monetary policy which, across the year, contributed to a substantial increase in fears over the possibility of a recession in 2023.

Information on economic indicators in the transition from 2022 to 2023 has, however, indicated that the global economy has shown resilience to the expected negative impact of rising interest rates. This is particularly visible in the improvement of the sentiment indicators of business operatives and consumers. Price indicators, not only on a level of consumers but also producers also began to moderate at the end of last year. In Europe, notwithstanding the high levels of uncertainty, mainly deriving from the continuation of the war in Ukraine, the risks of an upwards GDP bias may derive from the high level of gas storage achieved on the back of milder than usual winter temperatures, in addition to the costs of domestic consumption which benefited from fiscal measures and efficiency improvements in several intensive energy use sectors. However, in the light of the high levels of global uncertainty and Europe's reliance not only on major energy commodity markets but also on exports in the case of several countries, the bias in terms of outlook remains predominantly negative and not only in Europe.

Emerging countries have also speared the trend towards rate increases since 2021. This has also become equally imperative in the major developed economies and particularly so owing to the outbreak of war in Ukraine. The consequent disruptions have led to even higher inflation rates than those already recorded and which have risen to multi-decade highs in a large number of countries. This context has forced central banks to make additional endeavours to tighten their respective monetary policies.

Taking into consideration the gradual moderation of global growth, greater financial constraints could result in an even more marked slowdown or even a global recession this year. The possibility of stagflation, which is considered to be one of the main risks, continues to be recognised and emphasised by the major supranational institutions owing to a combination between a slowdown in growth, high inflation and tighter financial conditions, in a situation in which debt levels in many countries, including emerging countries, are at all-time highs. A stagflation scenario could be even worse if investors' expectations regarding the decisions of central banks are not correctly and promptly anticipated. The materialisation of this risk could generate significant capital outflows, mainly from emerging and developing to developed countries.

The high level of inflation that started to become a factor of uncertainty at the beginning of the preceding year was confirmed to be more persistent than anticipated. The possibility of prolonged high prices fuelling both an increase in economic actors' expectations of inflation and a wage-price spiral, particularly at a time when productivity has been low for several years, is a risk, as it could eventually contribute to even much higher inflation levels over the next few years. Additional shocks in energy and food prices may continue to occur, particularly in cases in which supply is more sensitive not only to the evolution of the war in Ukraine but also to the depreciation of the main currencies of exporting countries vis-à-vis the dynamics of the dollar. The risk of the transmission of all these effects to underlying inflation could certainly lead to a further tightening of monetary policy and consequently, general market funding conditions

Additional risks could contribute to an even more considerable deterioration in the global economy's growth trajectory, particularly a reopening of China's economy, if this results in the spread of new waves of infection over other regions of the globe. They are also linked to the possible heightening of geopolitical tensions, not only in relation to the territory of Ukraine with a continued adjustment of restrictive monetary policy measures in excess of expectations, which could have a negative impact on both private and public sector financing capacity and the level of the capacity to meet credit liabilities. Reference should also be made to the resumption and resurgence of the energy crisis on a European level in addition to the whole range of risks associated with climate change.

In greater detail and first of all taking China's economy into account, the downside risks to the recovery of economic growth are a result of the most significant slowdown in the real estate sector, both in terms of construction and sales and prices. This sector accounts for a direct and indirect proportion of $25 \%$ of total activity and has been one of the foundations of the economy. The reopening of the country following the easing of restrictions associated with the control of recent Covid-19 outbreaks in force over virtually the whole of last year, has been unfolding at a surprisingly fast pace in early 2023. This may be similar to the

experiences of the reopening process in most other countries which resulted in economic growth fuelled by consumption (which was suppressed during the pandemic years) and renewed pressure on production and supply chains as potentially negative factors in the evolution of inflation.

The war between Russia and Ukraine lies at the source of the acceleration of already existing inflationary pressures in 2021 and was an occurrence that, having contributed to increasing the level of adjustment to financial conditions, has considerably raised fears concerning the possibility of a global recession in 2023. Geopolitical tensions originating in the region could worsen if they encompass a larger number of countries, or if more aid from NATO members to Ukraine results in a more forceful reaction by Russia itself. The reduction of volatility in financial markets and review of the most affected asset classes in 2022 appear to indicate that investors are convinced that the intensity of the war in Ukraine will begin to wane and move towards a negotiated resolution to the end of the conflict, limiting the risks of a fresh escalation. The current absence of any kind of pre-agreement or talks between the parties may, however, indicate quite the opposite, i.e. an imminent escalation of the conflict, in the form of further attacks on civilian infrastructures or the fresh imposition of restrictions on maritime export capacity in the Black Sea.

Tensions in the European energy market, in 2022, may reoccur this year taking into account that it was only last year that Russia suspended natural gas flows through the Nord Stream pipeline with no end date and banned oil exports from 1 February to countries committing to the application of the price cap of $\$ 60$ per barrel of Russian oil, set by the European Union, G7 and Australia. Notwithstanding, the capacity to accumulate reserves, greater efficiency in gas use, new liquefied natural gas (LNG) contracts signed in the meantime and a winter that by the end of the first half appeared less rigorous, were factors that, for the time being, have reduced the risk of an energy crisis and which may well come as a positive surprise. Markets have reassessed this risk, and natural gas prices in Europe have recently fallen sharply to below those prior to the war after having risen to maximum values in the summer.

As in the preceding year, the risk that geopolitical tensions could potentially spread to other regions remains considerable, namely the potential worsening of relations between mainland China and Taiwan, which has been the subject of territorial dispute for several decades. Taiwan plays a very important role in the production/distribution of semiconductors, which are crucial production components in numerous industrial sectors, and particularly the automotive sector. This represents a potentially disruptive factor in the functioning of supply chains.

Another risk that has been pointed out by international institutions in 2022 concerns the possibility of calibration errors between monetary policy adjustments and fiscal and budget policy, which may contribute to the occurrence of liquidity shocks, intensifying economic slowdown and increasing global debt ratios. Expectations at the beginning of the year have revolved around the thesis that central banks are close to the end of the period of adjustment of their respective base rates. However, the main central banks are making it clear that this more restrictive cycle is not yet complete, notwithstanding the slowdown in rate hikes. In the US, following a reduction from 75 bps to 50 bps, the Federal Reserve has indicated that there will only be a change in policy when the labour market shows signs of weakening, a scenario which so far does not appear to be the case. The labour market typically lags the cycle in terms of GDP. Accordingly a degree of adjustment on a level of central bank base rates guided mainly by the respective indicators, could result in a deeper recession than currently expected. Similarly, in Europe, the European Central Bank has also softened its approach, slowing the rate of interest rate hikes in 2022, although it still accepts that there will still have to be a significant increase in 2023 and at a constant rate to achieve sufficiently restrictive levels in order to ensure a return of inflation to the $2 \%$ medium term target. This monetary policy readjustment by the main central banks, in setting their base rates at levels far above those considered adequate, particularly after having been left at a very low level over a long period of time, has posed a negative risk in terms of investors' expectations of the likelihood and intensity of a recession.

The tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve and other central banks may, more than anything else, add risks to the performance of the real estate sector and these risks will be all the greater the higher the rate of growth in house prices in each country to date. In this sense, it should be noted that prices at the beginning of this year were at extreme levels in a large number of developed countries.

The potential shock to household debt burdened with variable-rate financing is a major credit risk. There have already been increases in the amounts of households' monthly mortgage payments as interest rates on loans have continued to peak since 2008 as the year of the last major financial crisis. In the event of a prolonged recession, the growth of unemployment will further accentuate the amounts of credit in default, which so far has not happened.

The risk of corporate insolvencies has increased, owing to the increase in the costs of raw materials and intermediate goods, tightening financial constraints, disruptions that can still be felt in supply chains and,

most importantly for European countries, the energy crisis related to interruptions of imports. An already adverse scenario has been aggravated by the possibility of an increase in average collection periods, which would have a marked effect on the cash flow of non-financial corporations. So far, corporate defaults are at low absolute values, reflecting the good results of most companies in 2022 and in many cases with surplus cash.

Despite the lessening of pandemic-related risks, they remain relevant in terms of possibility and need if restrictive measures are re-established to some degree, ranging from social distancing, cancellation of trips and limitations on the normal movement of goods and persons. This is currently the case involving restrictions on arrivals of passengers from Chinese territory in several European countries.

Lastly, risks associated with climate change and natural disasters continue to be included in the many possibilities of potential adverse events, as changing weather patterns contribute to increasingly disruptive situations, aggravated by the fact that public and private resources are being asked to face the latest crises, which will tend to limit the speed and scale of mitigation efforts in coming years.

# Banking sector 

The current context of monetary policy normalisation, following a period of very low interest rates over a long period of time, its speed of adjustment and expected magnitude, will affect the financial position of Portugal's private sector. Although there has been an increase in the savings of Portuguese households during the pandemic's most acute phase, the cumulative effect of inflation and higher interest rates is likely to reduce their disposable income and have a negative effect on the financial and liquidity situation of companies, increasing credit risk in the case of credit institutions in Portugal. This will continue to be one of the biggest challenges facing the national banking sector in 2023. In parallel, the ECB's elimination of monetary and liquidity stimuli adds to the possibility of increases in default risks in the country. However, the introduction of decree law 80-A/2022 of 25 November which aims to mitigate the impacts of the rise of benchmark rate indexers in credit agreements for the acquisition or construction of homes for their owners' own permanent residence, which will remain in force up to the end of 2023, in addition to the "Mais habitação" (More Housing) legislative package will, over the short term, lessen the possibility of an increase in the level of defaults by households.

Nevertheless, revaluations of market interest rates and risk premia will increase net interest income. However, during the adjustment period of the base rate as the preferred monetary policy instrument, there may be depreciation in terms of the banks' portfolio of government debt securities, particularly in the case of instruments with higher interest rate risks.

Notwithstanding the stable and comfortable situation of national banks in terms of their capital and liquidity, a significant increase in credit default by the private sector may affect profitability, and as a corollary, the sector's solvency. Interest rate hikes could bring additional pressure to bear on institutions' funding costs in the wholesale market, and in particular, the probability of meeting the final MREL requirement by 1 January 2024.

Among the recent challenges faced by Portuguese banks, the digital transformation of financial services appears to be most in need of mitigating related risks. Increased digitalisation, not only brings with it a greater risk of cyber attack, but also greater risks in terms of money-laundering and the financing of terrorism. The automated execution of a large number of processes involving higher levels of technological complexity, not only adds to operational risk but also requires greater sophistication in management terms and the internal risk controls implemented by institutions' management and executive bodies.

Reference should, lastly, be made to the overall direction taken by the financial sector towards a more sustainable economy and society, firstly in environmental terms, but also from the point of view of social inclusion. In order to ensure a path towards an economy with a low carbon footprint, institutions must continue to make progress in terms of their energy efficiency and internal waste management processes, their contacts with customers and, in particular, their management of the right incentives to allow a structural change in household and corporate allocations in order to ensure a more sustainable economy.

CGD ended 2022 with a consolidated net income of $€ 843$ million, up $44 \%$ over the end of 2021 figure of $€ 583$ million. In an unstable economic environment, the evolution of CGD's results in 2022 are justified essentially due to three effects: 1) obtaining a core operating income of $€ 474$ million above the figure recorded in 2021, offsetting the $€ 444$ million increase in operating costs ( $€ 404$ million of which are related to non-recurring factors); 2) the increase in the results of the international activity, with a positive progression of the financial margin in most countries and a positive global impact from the exchange rate variation and 3) the decrease of $€ 174$ million in provisions and impairments, compared to 2021 (taking into account the non-recurring recording of provisions associated with personnel restructuring costs, carried out in 2021).

[^0] [^0]: 2 The shareholding in Banco Comercial do Atlântico (BCA) was, in December 2022, classified under "Non-current assets held for sale", therefore, and for comparative purposes only, the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 was restated, since IFRS 5 "NonCurrent Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations" only requires the restatement of the income statement.

This evolution recorded in net income allowed for an increase of 2.8 percentage points in return on equity (ROE), from $7.0 \%$ in the same period last year to $9.8 \%$ in December 2022.

# NET INCOME 

(EUR million)
![img-17.jpeg](img-17.jpeg)

Consolidated net interest income was up by $€ 429$ million ( $+44 \%$ ), mainly on account of CGD Portugal's contribution (up $€ 308$ million), reflecting the rise in interest rates in retail operations and the positive impact related to treasury and securities portfolio operations. The contribution of the international activity was also relevant to the evolution of net interest income (up $€ 119$ million), with emphasis on BCI Moçambique (up $€ 60$ million) and BCG Angola (up $€ 40$ million). The increase in the net interest income also includes the exchange rate variation ( $+€ 70$ million, $+16 \%$ ), as well as the effect of the increase in the volume of the loan portfolio, and also the variation in pricing which, despite the increase in the index, was attenuated by the reduction of spreads.

Commissions were up $€ 45$ million ( $+8 \%$ ) compared to December 2021. International activity contributed with a growth of $€ 5$ million, with the increase in Portugal focusing on fees charged with means payment ( $+€ 15$ million), with purchases with CGD cards registering a $20 \%$ growth compared to 2021, and the sale of investment products: placement of investment funds ( $+€ 9$ million) and insurance brokerage activity ( $+€ 9$ million), with Caixa Gestão de Ativos reinforcing its position as market leader in the securities investment fund segment.

## NET FEES AND COMMISSIONS

(EUR million)
![img-18.jpeg](img-18.jpeg)

Income from financial operations was up $€ 42$ million (up $24 \%$ ) compared to that obtained in December 2021, totaling $€ 216$ million. Domestic activity contributed with around half of the recorded change ( $€ 20$ million), based on results with interest rate derivatives and the impact of the sale of positions in restructuring funds, which offset the effect of the extraordinary gains obtained in 2021. Net of the referred to extraordinary effects, income from financial operations was up $€ 64$ million (up 50\%).

Other operating income was up $€ 46$ million compared to 2021, essentially explained by the effect of the disposal of real estate in Portugal ( $€ 25$ million) and French branch ( $€ 36$ million). Deducting extraordinary effects, the change is negative by $€ 31$ million.

# OPERATING COSTS 

(EUR million)
![img-19.jpeg](img-19.jpeg)

On a consolidated level, operating costs were up $58 \%$ by $€ 444$ million, compared to 2021, an evolution determined by non-recurring events in 2021 (of which: a $€ 145$ million reduction in provisions for past services associated with the medical services protocol signed by CGD in Portugal and $€ 47$ million for the staff restructuring program) and in 2022 (of which: $€ 53$ million in provisions for the staff restructuring program and $€ 246$ million relating to the agreement in principle concluded with the Government for the transfer of liabilities with pensions held by the Pension Fund). Recurring operating costs in December 2022 were up $€ 40$ million ( $+5 \%$ ) compared to 2021. Deducting the extraordinary effects that occurred in 2021 and 2022, the contribution of domestic activity was down $€ 2$ million.

In the international activity, reference should also be made to BCI Moçambique's operating costs, which were up $€ 22$ million ( $+20 \%$ ) largely explained by the positive exchange rate evolution ( $+€ 17$ million) and BCG Angola, up $€ 12$ million ( $+43 \%$ ), justified exclusively by the exchange rate effect.

(2) Calculated in accordance with Bank of Portugal Instruction No. 6//2018.

Reference should be made to the influence that the aforementioned non-recurring factors had on the evolution of Caixa's efficiency ratios. The cost-to-income ratio of CGD's current activity continues to demonstrate a favourable trend, displaying its sustained efficiency, with reference levels at European level, essencially due to the increase of income in 2022. The ratio of $39.1 \%$ in December 2022, compares well with the ratio of $48.0 \%$ at the end of 2021.

Also, the ratio of employee costs to total core operating income output changes significantly when considering non-recurring effects. Thus, instead of registering a deterioration, this ratio reflects an improvement from $32.5 \%$ in 2021 to $24.3 \%$ at the end of 2022, thanks to the $2.2 \%$ decrease in current personnel costs combined with the relevant increase in total core operating income.

# NET OPERATING INCOME BEFORE IMPAIRMENTS BY SEGMENT OF ACTIVITY

| Net Operating Income before Impairments | 982.2 | 1,101.4 | 119.2 | $12.1 \%$ |

As a result, net operating income before impairments was up $€ 119.2$ million to $€ 1,101.4$ million at the end of 2022. For this evolution, the contribution of the international activity was essential, main responsible for the increase in this item. However, excluding the non-recurring effects in the 2021 and 2022 activity, net operating income before impairments was up $€ 469$ million, due to the evolution of domestic commercial banking activity.

With a positive impact on the net income, provisions and impairments were down $€ 174$ million, resulting from a lower level of credit impairments, considering the stability observed in the asset quality indicators after the most critical period of the covid-19 pandemic. In fact, loan impairment net of recoveries went from $€ 42$ million in 2021 to -€5 million in 2022, resulting in a credit risk cost of -1 bp . ( +8 bp in 2021).

| Provisions and impairments for period | 145.1 | $-28.8$ | $-174.0$ | $-119.9 \%$ |

It should be noted, however, that the change in provisions and impairments was also influenced by nonrecurring factors, of which reference should be made to the reversal of $€ 60$ million, associated with the 2022 Early Retirement Plan, while in 2021 there was a reinforcement of the impairment associated with this Plan, in the amount of $€ 104$ million. Deducting the extraordinary effects that occurred in 2021 and 2022, provisions and impairments were down $€ 57$ million.

It should also be noted that credit recovery activities, including the write-off of assets and the disposal of non performing loans (NPL) and properties, had an impact on several components of CGD Group's income statement, essentially resulting in increases in net interest income, other operating results and in the recovery of impairments, with a total positive impact of $€ 62$ million in December 2022.

The tax burden borne in 2022 was similar to that of the previous year. However, tax and other operating income were impacted by the $24 \%$ increase in extraordinary contributions to the sector and regulatory costs which, as a whole, in December 2022 totalled $€ 80$ million, an increase of $€ 16$ million compared to 2021. Deducting the non-recurring effects that occurred in 2021 and 2022, taxes were down by $€ 7$ million.

As regards the remaining items in CGD Group's income statement, the results of companies, as measured by the equity accounting method, totalled $€ 48$ million and were down $16 \%$ over December 2021. The results from held-for-sale subsidiaries totalled $€ 17$ million, up $€ 5$ million over 2021. The non-controlling interests component was up $€ 30$ million, of which $€ 18$ million were associated with exchange rate variations affecting CGD's main subsidiaries. Income from equity instruments was up by $8 \%$ in December 2022, and totalled $€ 14$ million.

The securities investments balance was down $11.6 \%$ by $€ 2,462$ million over the preceding year amount to $€ 18,689$ million at the end of 2022. This evolution as determined by the decrease in financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, which were down by $€ 3,664$ million ( $-60.7 \%$ ), compared to the end of 2021. This evolution reflects the liquidity management strategy followed by CGD, with the sale of public debt securities and those of other public issuers, to be counteracted by the increase in investments at amortized cost in Portuguese debt instruments and foreign issuers.

Loans and advances to corporates \& General and government registered a slight increase by $€ 1$ million. Reference should be made, in terms of activity sectors, to the increases in Transportation ( $+10.7 \%$ ), retail sale ( $+8.7 \%$ ) and Construction and real estate ( $+1.1 \%$ ), in contrast to the decrease in consulting, scientific technical activities and similar, electricity, gas and wate and 'Mining and Manufacturing.

The loans and advances to individual customers balance increased by $1.8 \%$ to $€ 30,301$ million over the previous year.

In Portugal, growth was recorded in all segments, namely Corporate \& General goverment ( $+0.7 \%$ ), mortgage loans ( $+1.4 \%$ ) and credit for consumption and other purposes ( $14.2 \%$ ), reflecting the initiatives of the Strategic Plan 2021-2024 in the consumer credit area.CGD achieved a domestic credit market share of $18 \%$ in december 2022 ( $15 \%$ for corporate and $24 \%$ for mortgage loans) maintaining the leadership position in total loans, in individuals and in mortgage loans.

Asset quality continued to trend to improvement with NPLs (non-performing loans as defined by the EBA) down $13.3 \%$ by $€ 283$ million over December 2021 owing to the positive evolution in the components of cured credit, recoveries, sales and write-offs.

The improvement in Caixa's asset quality was also felt in terms of real estate held for sale which was down $€ 110$ million over the preceding year, totalling $€ 291$ million at the end of 2022, the lowest value since 2008. The balance on the Restructuring Funds also decreased by $€ 235$ million with the successful completion of the Crow Project, a process for the sale of investment units in several funds, enabling 2022 to end with an exposure of $€ 205$ million, less than half of the $€ 440$ million recorded in the preceding year.

## Resources

Customer deposits accounted for 90\% of CGD's liabilities in December 2022, clearly illustrating the characteristics of a bank geared to the Portuguese retail market, operating for the benefit of households and companies.

Customer deposits increased by $€ 4,934$ million ( $+6.2 \%$ ) when compared to the end of the previous year, an evolution essentially justified by the high savings rate in Portugal.

## Liquidity

The fact that CGD continues to enjoy significant liquidity, made it possible to reimburse $€ 1.25$ billion in covered bonds without recourse to market refinancing.

In addition, after obtaining prior authorisation from the European Central Bank (ECB), the early repayment option on the perpetual additional tier 1 capital issuance was exercised on the first contractually defined date for the call for the amount of $€ 500$ million and an interest rate of $10.75 \%$, which enabled CGD to achieve significant annual savings in interest.

The early repayment of the $€ 2.5$ billion Nostrum Mortgages 2010 securitisation issuance was made in August 2022. The bonds had been fully subscribed for by CGD.

During the last quarter of 2022, CGD reimbursed the funding obtained from the ECB (third series of Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations - TLTRO-III), within the scope of the Eurosystem's monetary policy measures, which totalled 5.8 billion euros.

The total amount of around $€ 15$ billion in assets available as Eurosystem collateral remained, however, stable, together with a significant volume of the balance of funds held with the Bank of Portugal.

The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) at the end of 2022, stood at $303.4 \%$, which was much higher than the current regulatory liquidity coverage requirement of $100 \%$. Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) stood at $182.6 \%$.

# Capital management 

As at 31 December 2022, consolidated shareholders' equity was up $€ 196$ million, to $€ 9,483$ million, over the end of 2021. The reduction of $€ 500$ million in "Other capital instruments", which referred to securities representing additional Tier 1 own funds (Additional Tier 1) that were called in March 2022, was offset by the $€ 499$ million increase in "Other reserves and retained earnings", already taking into account the payment of dividends to the Shareholder. This change is justified, among others, by the incorporation of the positive results of 2021 and by the positive impacts of exchange rate variations.

In 2022, the payment of dividends to CGD's shareholder, the Portuguese State, reached the amount of $€ 378.2$ million considering its robust financial situation and its net income for 2021. This amount included an amount previously withheld in accordance with the recommendations of the European Central Bank (ECB) regarding the distribution of dividends during the Covid-19 pandemic complying with the Dividend Policy currently in force.

The fully loaded CET1, Tier 1 and Total ratios, including net income for the period deducted of the maximum distributable amount according to the dividend payment ratio of the previous year, were $18.7 \%, 18.7 \%$ and $20.2 \%$ respectively, meeting CGD's current capital requirements with a comfortable margin. These ratios, above the Portuguese and European average, show CGD's robust and adequate capital position.

Over the course of 2022 CGD took notice of its SREP requirements applicable from 2023 onwards, and reference should be made to the Pillar 2 requirement for CGD in 2023 is $1.9 \%$, which represents a decrease of 10 b.p. compared to 2022 and 35 bp . compared to 2021 (two consecutive reductions), thus reflecting an improved perception by the Supervisor of the institution's global risk profile.

For the determination of own funds and consolidated prudential ratios at 31 December 2022, as reported to the supervisor, a net profit of around $€ 483,723$ million was considered, as authorised by the ECB, under no. 2 or article 26 of regulation (EU) 575/2013 and articles 3, 4 and 5 of decision (EU) 2015/656 of the European Central Bank of 4 February, 2015 (on the inclusion of interim or year-end profits in common equity tier 1 capital, which amount was determined on net accounting profit of $€ 837.8$ million from the prudential perimeter, net of around $€ 354.0$ million for the maximum amount of distributable dividends in accordance with the preceding year's dividend payment ratio (implementation of decision (EU) 2015/656 of the ECB conditions under which credit institutions may include interim or year-end profits in common equity tier 1).

## Changes to the regulatory and supervisory framework

Law 23-A/2022, transposing directive (EU) no. 2019/878 on access to banking activity and prudential supervision and directive (EU) no. 2019/879 on the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment companies was published on 9 December 2022 and amends the RGICSF (general credit institutions and financial corporations regime), securities code and related legislation.

As regards the changes to the new version of the RGICSF document, in terms of own funds, reference should be made to the change in the maximum O-SII reserve requirement (reserve for other systemically important institutions) requirements from $2 \%$ to $3 \%$ and the restrictions on distributions (setting out how to calculate the maximum distributable amount, focused on meeting the minimum requirements). In terms of resolution reference should also be made to the introduction of restrictions on distributions of more than the

maximum distributable amount, focused on compliance with minimum own funds and eligible liabilities requirements.

On 8 November 2022, the EU Council published its general guidance on the European Commission's legislative package on a set of changes to the Basel III regulatory framework for the implementation of the CRR III and CRD VI, which is scheduled to come into force on 1 January 2025.

# Main aggregates contributing to the annual change of the consolidated CET1 ratio 

The change in terms of the CET1 ratio between December 2021 and December 2022 is explained by the improvement of own funds to levels making it possible to accommodate the increase in risk-weighted assets (RWAs):

- The improvement of around $€ 345.4$ million in common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital represents a positive impact of 80 basis points (bp) on the CET1 ratio and essentially derives from the contribution of the following components;
- The approximate amount of $€ 483.7$ million in net profit authorised by the ECB and calculated in own funds was the component responsible for the major positive contribution, in accounting for an increase of 112 bp on the change in terms of the CET1 ratio;
- The approximate change of around $€ 157.1$ million in other reserves and retained earnings which contributed to a 36 bp increase on the change in terms of the CET1 ratio;
- The negative evolution of around $€ 125.4$ million in revaluation reserves (essentially related to debt instruments), resulting in an impact of -29 bp on the change in terms of the CET1 ratio;
- The increase in the deduction related to the pension fund surplus (notwithstanding the decrease in the value of the asset which was more than offset by the reduction in liabilities, contributing to an increase in the funding surplus over 2021) of around $€$ 100.3 million which resulted in a -23 bp change in terms of the CET1 ratio, and
- The increase of around $€ 52.5$ million in the deduction of deferred tax assets (for tax losses) with an impact of -12 bp on the change in terms of the CET1 ratio.

The impacts of the change in net profit and the pension fund surplus on the above referred to CET1 ratios, reflect the effects of the liquidation operation on CGD's pension fund owing to the transfer of liabilities to CGA (Caixa Geral de Aposentações), totalling an increase of around $€ 136.3$ million in CET1 in December 2022.

- RWA between December 2021 and December 2022 were up by around $€ 727.8$ million. This had an impact of -30 bp on the CET1 ratio. This change is essentially explained by the following factors:
- An increase of around $€ 681$ million (-28 bp in terms of the CET1 ratio) of RWA for credit risk on BCI Mozambique. This increase is explained by the combined effect of the 6\% appreciation of the metical's exchange rate and the growth of its position at risk, particularly the $150 \%$ weighting of its sovereign exposure.
- The increase of around $€ 338$ million (-14 bp in terms of the CET1 ratio) of RWAs for credit risk on BNU Macau, justified both by the effect of the around 6\% exchange rate appreciation of the pataca (MOP) and Hong Kong dollar (HKD) and increased business, particularly in the corporate segment.
- The favourable evolution of Angola's external rating, offsetting the impact of the 15.6\% appreciation of the Kwanza on the RWA for credit risk deriving from the activity of BCG Angola.
- Growth of the credit portfolio collateralised by real estate, particularly CGD Portugal's headquarters building, with an impact of $€ 218$ million on RWA ( -9 bp in terms of the CET1 ratio).

- Reduction of exposure to investment units in funds, with a contribution to a decrease of €346 million in RWA ( +14 bp in terms of the CET1 ratio);
- Decrease in exposure to derivatives, particularly in the corporate segment, with a global contribution of €336 million in the reduction of RWA ( +14 bp in terms of the CET1 ratio);
- Decrease in the volume of investments in credit institutions with a contribution of €183 million to the decrease of RWA by ( +7 bp in terms of the CET1 ratio);
- Decrease in the non-performing assets portfolio, with a global contribution of €246 million on the reduction of RWA ( +10 bp in terms of the CET1 ratio);
- An increase of €253 million (-10 bp in the CET1 ratio) in RWA for market risk. The exchange rate appreciation observed in 2022, reflecting the increase in open foreign exchange positions in patacas (MOP) and Hong Kong dollars (HKD), but also in meticais (MZN) and kwanzas (AOA) explains most of the increase in RWAs for foreign exchange risk;
- An increase of €238 million in RWA for operational risk with an impact of -10 bps in terms of the CET1 ratio.


# Capital requirements in 2022 applicable to consolidated activity under SREP 

Based on supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) results and the Bank of Portugal's communication on the additional capital buffer required pursuant to its O-SII (other systemically important institutions) status, CGD was notified by the European Central Bank (ECB) of its minimum capital requirements in 2022, more details on which are latterly provided.

The ECB's letter of 2 February 2022 defined the minimum total SREP capital requirement (TSCR) of 10.0\% (of which $8.0 \%$ for Pillar 1 and $2.0 \%$ for Pillar 2 - P2R), with a phased-in CET1 ratio of $9.125 \%$ required from CGD on a consolidated basis, which includes:
(i) a minimum CET1 ratio required by Pillar 1 of $4.5 \%$;
(ii) a minimum CET1 ratio required by Pillar 2 (P2R) of 1.125\%;
(iii) a CCB (capital conservation buffer) of $2.50 \%$;
(iv) an "other systemically important institutions" buffer of $1.0 \%$; and
(v) a countercyclical capital reserve of $0 \%$ of the total amount of positions at risk (as defined by the Bank of Portugal for fourth quarter 2022).

CGD must also achieve a minimum tier 1 ratio of $11.00 \%$ and a total capital ratio of $13.50 \%$ in 2022.
As regards the own funds buffer for "Other systemically important institutions" (O-SII), the Bank of Portugal defined a gradual phasing-in period of $0.25 \%$ per annum between 2018 and 2021, with the requirement in the last period expected to be $1 \%$.

However, to allow the banking system to mitigate the shock of the economic and financial conditions deriving from the Covid-19 pandemic, the Bank of Portugal granted the possibility of extending the period for full compliance with the O-SII buffer percentage for another year. Caixa was informed of this decision in May 2020.

The phased implementation period of the own funds buffer for "Other systemically important institutions" ended at the close of 2021, with a requirement of $1 \%$ starting 2022.

On 30 September, 2022, the Bank of Portugal announced that the value of the countercyclical own funds buffer would remain at $0 \%$.

Caixa must therefore achieve the following minimum ratios in 2022:

# Capital requirements for 2023 applicable to consolidated activity under the SREP 

The last SREP decision of 14 December 2022 and the Bank of Portugal's communication on the additional capital buffer pursuant to its O-SII (other systemically important institutions) status required Caixa Geral de Depósitos, S.A. to achieve a total ratio (TSCR) of $9.90 \%$ on a consolidated basis in 2023 (of which $8 \%$ for Pillar 1 and $1.90 \%$ for Pillar 2 - P2R), with the amount of the P2R defined for CGD being $56.25 \%$ covered by CET1 instruments, $18.75 \%$ by AT1 instruments and $25 \%$ by tier 2 instruments, applicable starting and including March 2023.

CGD's minimum phased-in CET1 capital requirement, on a consolidated basis, is now therefore $9.069 \%$ and includes;
(i) a minimum CET1 ratio required by Pillar 1 of $4.50 \%$;
(ii) a minimum CET1 ratio required by Pillar 2 (P2R) of 1.069\%;
(iii) a CCB (capital conservation buffer) of $2.50 \%$;
(vi) an "other systemically important institutions" buffer of $1.0 \%$; and
(iv) a countercyclical capital reserve of $0 \%$ of the total amount of positions at risk (as defined by the Bank of Portugal for first quarter 2023) as shown in the following table

CGD must also achieve a minimum tier 1 ratio of $10.925 \%$ and a total capital ratio of $13.40 \%$ in 2023.

## Repayment of additional tier 1 instrument

In 2021, Caixa asked for the ECB's authorisation to make an early repayment of the AT1 instrument for the amount of $€ 500$ million, which perpetual bond was issued in March 2017 under the recapitalisation plan

agreed between the Portuguese state and the European Commission, at market conditions, with international institutional investors at an interest rate of $10.75 \%$.

On 28 January 2022, CGD was authorised by the European Central Bank to make early repayment of the instrument eligible as additional tier 1 funds, effective 30 March 2022 as the first contractually scheduled call date.

# MREL 

CGD was informed of the Single Resolution Board's (SRB) decision to revise its MREL (minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities) requirements under the European Banking Resolution Directive (BRRD2), in first quarter 2022. According to this decision, starting 1 January 2024, CGD's own funds and eligible liabilities must be equivalent to $25.95 \%$ of total risk-weighted assets (including a combined buffer requirement of $3.5 \%$ ) and a total leverage exposure of $5.94 \%$.

In March 2023, CGD was notified regarding the new binding MREL decision determined by the SRB, which revokes and replaces the one received in 2022, establishing that, in order to comply with the MREL requirements, from 1 January 2024 onwards, CGD must hold an amount of own funds and eligible liabilities equivalent to $26.44 \%$ of total risk-weighted assets (including a combined capital reserve requirement of $3.5 \%$ ) and $6.27 \%$ of total leverage ratio exposure.

The requirements apply on a sub-consolidated basis for the determined resolution perimeter.
The preferred resolution strategy is the Multiple Point-of-Entry (MPE) approach. According to the decision currently in force, CGD is not subject to compliance with any minimum subordination requirement.

## Rating

On March 9, 2022, Fitch Ratings upgraded CGD's IDR and long-term preferred senior debt ratings from BB+ to BBB-, and revised its outlook from Positive to Stable.

The rating upgrade reflects the improvement in asset quality even during the pandemic period, the resilience of profitability - based on market leadership and strong levels of efficiency - and better capital ratios. The IDR and senior short-term preferred debt ratings were upgraded from B to F3.

With this change, CGD is now rated investment grade by the three international agencies that monitor its rating.

In May, DBRS affirmed CGD's rating at BBB, having revised the trend from Negative to Positive. This improvement reflects CGD's leadership position in Portugal, its solid funding and capital, as well as the resilience demonstrated during the pandemic.

In January 2023, Moody's upgraded CGD's deposit rating outlook to "Positive". At the same time, Moody's confirmed the deposit and long-term senior debt ratings at Baa2/Prime-2, as well as long-term senior nonpreferred debt at Baa3, while maintaining the senior debt outlook at "Stable". This initiative reflects Moody's expectation that the gradual reinforcement of CGD's risk profile, mainly in terms of asset quality, capital and profitability, will continue despite the demanding environment.

# 1.4.4.1. Domestic Activity 

Domestic activity's contribution to CGD Group's net income in 2022 was $€ 649.5$ million, up $44.5 \%$ from $€ 449.4$ million in 2021. CGD's activity in Portugal was the main responsible for the the net income in domestic activity, with a contribution of $€ 541$ million (up $€ 209$ million).

The positive performance of net interest income and commissions shows that domestic core activity is recovering from an adverse environment.

Conversely, operating costs were up $74.8 \%$, to $€ 930.3$ million, justified by the evolution of employee costs (up $€ 367.3$ million) influenced by non-recurring factors, of which: the signature of a new protocol with the "Social Services of CGD" which led to the reversal of the provision for the medical plan ( $€ 145$ million) in April 2021, and the agreement in principle established with the Portuguese Government for the transfer of pension liabilities financed by the Pension Fund ( $+€ 246$ million) in December 2022.

In 2022, provisions and impairments in domestic activity were down $€ 199.1$ million compared to 2021, due to the reduction of $€ 51.4$ million in net loan impairments and the reduction of $€ 147.7$ million in provisions and impairment of other assets (net), reflecting the favourable evolution compared to initial expectations in the context of a pandemic.

CaixaBI retained its position as a benchmark institution in Portugal's debt capital market's bond sectors, coming first in Bloomberg's ranking on bonds issued by domestic entities, having provided advisory services for an overall amount of $€ 1,429$ million in 15 issuances.

In the Portuguese public debt segment, CaixaBI was joint lead manager and bookrunner for the syndicated placement of the new 10 year benchmark $1.65 \%$ treasury bonds issuance maturing in 2032 and co-lead manager for the syndicated placement of the new 20 year benchmark $1.15 \%$ treasury bonds issuance maturing in 2042, each for a global amount of $€ 3$ billion.

In the sustainability segment, reference should be made to CaixaBI's role as joint lead manager and bookrunner for Caixa's two Green Bonds Senior Preferred issuances ( $€ 300$ million and $€ 500$ million) which are the only issuances in this format to-date by Portuguese financial institutions. Reference should also be made to the joint global coordination of the issuance of Mota-Engil's sustainability bonds 2022-2027 ( $€ 70$ million) and GreenVolt's green bonds 2022-2027 ( $€ 150$ million) both in the form of a public offering and public exchange offer (in the case of Mota-Engil). Note should also be taken of the organisation and leadership of the issuance of sustainability-linked bonds by The Navigator Company ( $€ 150$ million), NOS ( $€ 75$ million) and Sonae Sierra ( $€ 50$ million).

In the corporate debt segment, reference should also be made to CaixaBI's role as joint lead manager and bookrunner for the $€ 455$ million bond issuance of the Autonomous Region of the Azores, organisation and joint lead of the $€ 260$ million and $€ 225$ million bond issuances of the Autonomous Region of Madeira, organisation and lead of the $€ 100$ million bond issuance of Locarent, Semapa ( $€ 100$ million) Cin ( $€ 40$ million) and Greenvolt ( $€ 35$ million). Across this period the bank was also co-lead manager for UBS, Credit Suisse, Santander, HSBC and ING issuances. Reference should also be made to CaixaBI's intervention as the contracting entity for the Sport Lisboa e Benfica - Futebol, SAD bonds ( $€ 60$ million) public offering and the Futebol Clube do Porto - Futebol, SAD bonds ( $€ 50$ million) public offering and exchange operation, in addition to the organisation and structuring of the credit assignment operation of SU Eletricidade ( $€ 80$ million) and the organisation and lead of twenty one new commercial paper programmes for corporate customers, particularly in the sustainability segment in a sustainability-linked commercial paper programme for NOS, four ESG-linked programmes for the Sonae group and a Green commercial paper programme for Corticeira Amorim.

As regards advisory activity in the organisation and structuring of financing, reference should be made to the successful completion of the refinancing of Centro Comercial Parque Atlântico ( $€ 22.5$ million) and successful completion of operations in the project finance, real estate and acquisition finance areas.

Also relevant is CaixaBI's advisory role in Banco Caixa Geral Angola's initial public offering, GreenVolt's capital increase in the form of a public offering and the organisation and structuring of a public offer of convertible bonds by Farminveste. Reference should also be made to financial advisory services to Altri for the distribution of dividends, an operation in which the bank also acted as a paying agent.

CaixaBI continued to operate as a liquidity provider on a collection of Euronext Lisbon listed securities which continued to enjoy a high rating from Euronext as well as acting as the market-maker for a Fundiestamo real estate fund.

The venture capital activity of Caixa Capital as a wholly owned CaixaBI company, focused on the analysis of investment opportunities and management of the portfolio of subsidiary companies held by the venture capital funds under its management. Additional investments of $€ 13.3$ million and divestments of $€ 16.5$ million in fund subsidiaries, split between the two funds under management, were made.

# Asset management 

According to data published by the Portuguese Association of Investment Funds, Pensions and Assets (APFIPP), in December 2022, the national market for unit trust funds was down $13.8 \%$ over the start of the year to $€ 17.1$ billion. Caixa Gestão de Ativos retained its market lead with a share of $36.6 \%$ ( $€ 6.268$ billion at the end of the year). This was an increase of 1.6 percentage points over its market share at the end of 2021. Notwithstanding the increase in market share, the amounts under Caixa Gestão de Ativos management were down $€ 684$ million and across-the-board to all fund managers.

Caixa Gestão de Ativos continues to lead the market in the national higher value-added funds, shares and multiasset segments.

In the multiasset funds segment managed in Portugal, the Caixa Seleção Global Moderado fund, with €1,191 million under management at the end of 2022, was the second largest fund in the national market.

In the share segment special reference should be made to the Caixa Ações Líderes Globais fund which invests in the worldwide listed shares of companies with strong brand recognition factors, for several reasons:

- It has retained its status as the largest investment fund in the national market, ending 2022 with $€ 2,163.8$ million under management;
- It ranks as the third placed annual fund with the highest annualised returns over the last five years, according to data published by APFIPP.


# Reinforcement of the incorporation of ESG principles in the management process of Caixa Gestão de Ativos 

The last few years have been marked by an acceleration of the integration of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) considerations in the investment strategy of Caixa Gestão de Ativos and CGD Pensões.

Both companies, as signatories to the PRI - Principles for Responsible Investment of the United Nations in 2019, have reinforced the importance of incorporating ESG factors in the investment process of the funds under management.

Socially responsible investment as a strategy and practice is aimed at incorporating environmental, social and corporate governance factors in investment decisions. The socially responsible investment approach therefore continues to be a strategic pillar of the activity of the fund managers and an integral part of the group's extended strategy, designed to support a more sustainable future.

In 2022 and in parallel with its response to the new regulatory requirements associated with this issue, particularly as regards regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 (SFDR - Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation) on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector, Caixa Gestão de Ativos and CGD Pensões have consolidated their ambition to set an example in the implementation of socially responsible investments, strengthening their operational approach, which remains centred on three main areas:

- Integration of ESG factors in investment processes, in parallel with the use of traditional financial analysis factors;
- Engagement with companies by exercising voting rights associated with assets under management;
- Involvement with target investment companies, fostering engagement on matters of socially responsible investment.

With this action, the fund managers simultaneously aim to safeguard concerns over sustainable development and leverage sustainable, long term yields in the best interests of their customers.

The "Sustainability Preferences Questionnaire" was implemented in August 2022 by management companies in compliance with a new regulatory requirement. It requests feedback from each customer on their aims in terms of sustainability they wish to see reflected in the management of their assets.

With regard to joining international initiatives, in September 2022, Caixa Gestão de Ativos joined the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative. This global initiative, officially launched in December 2020, brings together the efforts and commitment of its signatory international asset management companies regarding the decarbonisation of portfolios under management, thus contributing to achieving the goal of a zero level of net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This membership process was a natural step, owing to the management company's strategic commitment to meet the risks and challenges associated with climate change, contributing to the mitigation and reversal of global warming and aligning its performance with best ESG practice in the asset management industry

In line with the understanding of the management companies on their role in promoting environmental and/or social responsibility in terms of the Portuguese asset management industry, management companies have sought to contribute to a general improvement of financial literacy or focus on sustainable investments. In this context, Caixa Gestão de Ativos has contributed several press articles and has been involved in several conferences and the like on financial investment matters and the importance of integrating ESG criteria in investment processes in terms of asset management.

# 1.4.4.2. International activity 

CGD Group has continued to proceed, in compliance with the 2021-2024 Strategic Plan, with the restructuring of its international operations, on the basis of criteria of economic and strategic rationality, with a view to leveraging its respective results and achieving tight control of the associated risks, focusing on strategic countries for the Group's activity (countries and territories with strong cultural and commercial links with Portugal and enhancement of CGD's brand value).

CGD Group maintains a diversified international presence, with different models of representation (mainly subsidiaries, branches and representative offices), with greater focus on Portuguese-speaking countries and countries of Portuguese emigration, comprising different types of representation (mainly subsidiaries, branches and representative offices) in a permanent endeavour to promote the internationalisation (export, import, investment, partnerships, and other components) of Portuguese companies, proximity to the different Portuguese communities in such geographies, their business affinities with Portugal and boosting economic relations among the different geographies.

The group's brand value and image of trust associated with it is an unparalleled asset that gives it unique access to these local markets.

During 2022, governance quality has been further strengthened in the different international group member entities, with the aim of implementing international best practice, bringing each entity's governance model more into line with the model of the parent company and the group's strategic objectives, but always in due compliance with the legal obligations and specificities attached to each geography.

CGD's representativeness in the governing bodies of the international units and the effective monitoring of the committees that support these governing bodies, in parallel with the corporate exercise of control functions and the harmonization of corporate policies, are tools that contribute to the reinforcement and harmonization of the strategy of the Group and contribute to consolidated results and risk management. The same action focuses on increasing articulation between the various functional structures (business, support and control) of CGD and international entities, in favor of reinforcing their contribution to the Group's strategy and consolidated results.

In 2022, international entities continued the adoption of a wide range of policies, standards and procedures identical to those of CGD, ensuring the harmonisation of rules and practices within the group (including the sharing of good practice) in accordance with the most advanced international rules.

It is also a strategic priority to promote the development of an integrated vision of the Group's customer, reinforcing the articulation between CGD and international entities (and also among them), with the aim of boosting business and offering a better and broader service to the customer, functioning as a multi-service banking platform (cross-border payments, transfers, trade finance, and other services).

In terms of their contribution to the group's results, endeavours were made to leverage the results of international entities in the form of off-balance sheet income, reinforcing networking operations and CGD's role as a counterparty, investing in its capacity to provide its customers with more and better services, always in close articulation with the control of the associated risks.

# Contributions from the International Area 

The international business area's contribution to consolidated net income in December 2022 was up 44\% over 2021 to $€ 193$ million. This evolution was influenced by exchange rate variations occurring in the countries of CGD group's principal business units abroad ( $+€ 24$ million).
![img-26.jpeg](img-26.jpeg)

The main contributions to income from international activity were from BCI Moçambique (up €63 million), BNU Macao (up €45 million), BCG Angola (up €35 million) and France branch (up €32 million), the latter reflecting the non-recurring effect of the sale of its head office building.

The contribution of CGD Group's international units to the consolidated net income derived essentially from the positive performance of net interest income, but also from non-interest income items, which evidenced a scenario of economic recovery in the geographies in which CGD operates, offsetting the increase in operating costs (including exchange rate effects) recorded in the period. Accordingly, total operating income from international activity was up 34\% over December 2021.

Operating costs were, in turn, up 19\%, without offsetting the positive changes in net interest income and non interest income, resulting in a $49 \%$ increase in net operating income berfore impairments.

Provisions and impairments were up $€ 25$ million over 2021 mainly due to non-recurring reversals occurred last year.

# Main CGD Group companies 

## BNU Macao

In 2020 the Government of the Special Administrative Region of Macau extended the agencying agreements with the Bank of China and Banco Nacional Ultramarino as currency issuing banks for a period of ten years. This represents recognition of the role played by this Caixa group entity, which has issued currency for over 100 years, both as regards the development of the region and as a primary vehicle operating as a link between the Portuguese economy and Asian markets and Portuguese-speaking countries.

2022 was the 120th anniversary of BNU's presence in Macau, which was recognised by the Macau SAR authorities with the Silver Medal Lotus of Honour for its contribution to the adequate diversification of Macau's economy and development of its in-depth cooperation zone.

In the context of the pandemic, which extended across 2022, BNU, in accordance with Macau government directives continued to implement diverse measures to protect and support its customers, employees and communities, strengthening its support to the population and SME, by extending moratoria, lines of credit and consumer incentives.

One of BNU's main strategic objectives in 2022 was to re-engineer its branch office network (closing two and renewing another two branches) and achieve a strong focus on the digitalisation of processes and services available to its customers.

BNU made a net profit of 381.6 million patacas ( $€ 44.9$ million) and a return on equity (ROE) of $6.2 \%$ in 2022. Its default ratio remains at a low $1.1 \%$ and efficiency ratios have remained highly competitive in comparison to the industry average with a cost-to-income ratio of $40.6 \%$ and a cost-to-core income ratio of $35.9 \%$.

The loans and advances to customers portfolio was up $8.6 \%$ over 2021 to 27,470 million patacas (net). This increase partly derives from the $30.7 \%$ growth of loans to non-financial corporations in the form of an increase in syndicated credit. Mortgage lending, in line with the evolution of the market, was down $1.7 \%$ and consumer credit slightly up, reflecting the easing of the measures implemented during the pandemic.

Customer resources were up $7.4 \%$, mainly comprising residents' term deposits which were naturally boosted by the increase in the average interest rate on deposits and the increase of the deposits of integrated resorts

following the renewal of licences and the guarantees provided to the Macau SAR government. Against this background, the loans-to-deposits ratio was up $72.4 \%$ in 2022 in comparison to $71.6 \%$ in 2021.

In financial terms Macau is a highly competitive market with the presence of 32 banks, several of which among the largest in the world. BNU, however comes 5th in terms of balance sheet and credit. BNU has a $9 \%$ share of the market for credit cards and a market share of $30 \%$ for the salary accounts of employees of integrated resorts and civil servants.

Operating costs were slightly down by $0.04 \%$ over 2021. Employee costs, subject to a continuation of pressure on wages in a highly competitive, full employment labour market were up $2.2 \%$ Administrative overheads were slightly up by $0.9 \%$. Depreciation was down, partly owing to branch office closures.

As a consequence of the above and increase in interest rates, net operating income before impairment was up $12.8 \%$ to 557.7 million patacas.

BNU recognised net provisions and impairment of 127.3 million patacas in 2022. There was a considerable increase in impairment on credit (net) and on other financial assets owing to a downgrade of the securities of integrated resorts which is expected to be fully recoverable owing to the recent renewal of licences for an additional 10 years.

# France branch 

Geared to its natural market of the Portuguese community in France, the branch also services other (particularly Portuguese-speaking) communities and assists Portuguese companies operating in France, both in the sphere of bilateral trade between the two countries as in the freedom to provide services.

Across the course of 2022, France's economy suffered multiple shocks (including, inter alia, waves of the Omicron variant, major geopolitical tensions, rising energy prices, supply difficulties and interest rate hikes) which were responsible for creating high levels of uncertainty leading to a slowdown in economic growth notwithstanding the fiscal measures implemented.

It was in such an atypical macroeconomic environment, marked by uncertainty and an inflationary shock that the branch operated in 2022. Reference should be made, on the one hand, to the $2.6 \%$ decrease in lending over 2021 - largely deriving from the restrictive risk policy, in response to an increased level of economic uncertainty, and, on the other, a slight decrease in deposit-taking from customers in line with the decrease in the size of the credit portfolio (down $0.8 \%$ as opposed to an increase of $1.7 \%$ in 2021), in addition to a slowdown in securing transfers (up $3.9 \%$, against $10.2 \%$ in 2021).

2022 was also marked by the completion of the sales process of the headquarters building in France to further the objective of rationalising physical space occupancy accompanied by the search for solutions more adapted to the current and future needs of the France branch office headquarters' work teams. This operation provided the branch with non-recurring profit and, consequently, enabled it to improve its performance in the French market.

Operating profit was up $€ 17.1$ million over 2021 to $€ 44.5$ million. The main contributory factors to this extremely favourable evolution were the sharp increase in non-interest income owing to the above referred to non-recurring profit, as net interest income was slightly down by $3.8 \%$. Total operating income was up $€ 28.9$ million over the preceding year to $€ 121.2$ million, Operating costs were, on the other hand, up $12.7 \%$ by $€ 7.5$ million largely on account of the costs incurred on the sale of the headquarters building and rental of new replacement facilities and a $77.4 \%$ increase of $€ 4.2$ million in provisions and impairment following the significant increase in the level of economic uncertainty across the year. France branch therefore made a profit of $€ 30.6$ million, up $58.1 \%$ over the preceding year.

## Banco Caixa Geral Angola

Banco Caixa Geral Angola (BCGA or Caixa Angola) is an Angolan institution with a majority Caixa Geral de Depósitos group shareholding and was the first private banking institution to operate in Angola after independence.

BCGA has earned the status of a trusted institution, a partner in Angolan society, backing companies in terms of their business expansion and satisfying their individual aspirations, particularly providing the oil and gas sector and affluent personal customers with service levels of excellence.

The enormous potential of the country's demographic structure, in addition to expectations of an improvement in its economic and social environment, make it an attractive market, not risk-free, but with a wealth of opportunities. Caixa Angola is able to provide its customers with the experience and local knowledge necessary to operate a successful business in Africa, exploiting CGD group's network in order to broker the activities of foreign entities without a presence in Angola, capitalising on the perception of the robustness and confidence enjoyed by the group.

In April 2022, Caixa Angola, on the basis of a resolution of the board of its general meeting subscribed for a defined annual contribution retirement savings plan. This initiative reflects an investment and commitment to its existing and future employees.
$25 \%$ of BCGA's share capital owned by SONANGOL was sold on the stock exchange in third quarter 2022 in the form of an initial public offering resulting in an additional 691 shareholders and a success in terms of having been oversubscribed by a factor of 2.05 , culminating in a pro rata allocation of $48 \%$.

The evolution of the price of the shares quoted on the exchange was highly favourable, attaining a maximum price of Kz 17,575 during the session of 25 October 25. This was 3.52 times the amount of the initial public offering of Kz 5,000.

BCGA's net interest income of 42,905 million kwanzas in 2022 was up $17.4 \%$ over 2021.
Income from services and commissions was slightly up by $1.15 \%$ over 2021 to 7,918 million kwanzas in 2022. Further growth was mainly constrained by the negative impact of the change in the kwanza's value against the major currencies in addition to the reduction of commissions on securities owing to the new brokerage model.

Operating costs were down $5.4 \%$ in local currency owing to the optimisation of the procurement process as part of the management process for needs and purchases.

Net operating income before impairment was up $43.7 \%$ over the preceding year to 41,665 million kwanzas, fuelled by the increase of total operating income, based on higher levels of interest and similar income in net interest income.

BCGA's net assets were up $7.0 \%$ over the preceding year to 791,079 million kwanzas. This positive variation derives from the increase in cash and cash equivalents at central banks and investments at amortised cost (securities) offset by a reduction in investments and loans and advances to other credit institutions.

Gross credit was slightly up by $0.07 \%$ to 181,023 million kwanzas and balance sheet credit impairment down by around $1.59 \%$ to 14,076 million kwanzas in 2022.

Liabilities were up $5.3 \%$ over 2021, mainly owing to the increase in customer resources, whose positive change derived from the kwanza's depreciation against the major currencies in the last quarter of the year, to 656,158 million kwanzas in 2022.

# BCI Mozambique 

Mozambique's economy grew by an annualised $3.6 \%$ in third quarter 2022. According to the Bank of Mozambique (BdM), this growth reflects the good performance of the exporting sector, which particularly benefited from higher prices for the country's major export goods. The government of Mozambique (in its economic and social plan and state budget) and the IMF (in the World Economic Outlook report) forecast growth of $2.9 \%$ and $3.7 \%$ respectively for 2022.

December 2022 witnessed an increase in inflation to $10.91 \%$ ( $7.15 \%$ in December 2021), largely owing to the rising prices of: (i) food and non-alcoholic beverages; and (ii) transport, mainly owing to higher fuel prices in the international market, pursuant to which the BdM reviewed its base rates upwards to $17.25 \%$.

The metical remained stable against the US dollar ( $0.06 \%$ ) over 2022, owing to the balance between supply and demand and appreciated by $8.27 \%$ against the rand and $4.32 \%$ against the euro, reflecting the depreciation of the referred to currencies in the international market.

Given the above referred to macroeconomic scenario, Banco Comercial e de Investimentos (BCI) retained its leading position in Mozambique's banking system in the three main market share areas of credit, deposits and assets, at $24.25 \%, 25.41 \%$ and $23.68 \%$, respectively at the end of 2022 , having ended the year with 211 branches, 532 ATM and 13,427 items of POS equipment.

In balance sheet terms, net assets were up $10.8 \%$ to 204,392 million meticais, against 184,394 million meticais in December 2021. This evolution essentially reflects the growth of investments in credit institutions (up 10,107 million meticais) and public debt securities (up 8,658 million meticais) on account of the existing

liquidity surplus and consequent increase in investment in debt securities deriving from the increase in the exposure limit in January and as an investment alternative in a context of weak demand for credit.

The loans and advances to customers portfolio (net) was down $4.5 \%$ by 2,943 million meticais over the same period to 63,150 million meticais against 66,093 million in 2021, having been influenced by the relatively unfavourable macroeconomic environment of the last two years, characterised by lower demand for credit and high market interest rate levels.

Customer resources were up $8.8 \%$ over 2021 to 158,653 million meticais in December 2022, owing to the resumption of economic activity.

In December 2022, the loans-to-deposits ratio was down 5.34 pp over the same period 2021 (45.10\%) to $39.76 \%$.

Shareholders' equity was up 4,509 million meticais over 2021 to 28,069 million meticais. This evolution was essentially influenced by net profit for the year and increase of the legal reserve and the other and retained income reserves.

The solvency ratio of $27.97 \%$ at the end of the year was well above the minimum level of $14.0 \%$ legally established by the Bank of Mozambique.

BCI made a net profit of 8,078 million meticais in 2022, up $90.5 \%$ over 2021. This increase is explained by the good performance of total operating income (up 1,802 million meticais) and impairment and provisions (down 2,704 million meticais).

Total operating income amounted to 20,209 million meticais, against 18,407 million meticais for the same period 2021, driven by the $16.8 \%$ improvement of net interest income over 2021 to 15,705 million meticais, owing to the sharp hike in base rates. Non-interest income was down $15.6 \%$ over the same period last year to 4,598 million meticais, having been penalised by other operating income (down 1,241 million meticais) owing to the larger volume of extraordinary losses, in 2022, following the return of commissions to customers for the period from April 2018 to 2021, as instructed by the Bank of Mozambique.

Operating costs remained under control, with growth in employee and general administrative costs below inflation, as a result of containment and enhanced operational efficiency measures, resulting in a cost-toincome ratio of $42.4 \%$ ( $43.8 \%$ in December 2021).

CGD's separate activity, comprising its operations in Portugal and its France and East Timor branches generated net profit of $€ 672.3$ million in 2022 (up $52.3 \%$ over 2021).

Total operating income was up $€ 415.6$ million compared to December 2021 ( $+31.4 \%$ ), essentially due to the increase of $€ 309.6$ million in net interest income. The evolution of interest and similar income was the basis for this growth. In CGD's core activity, reference should also be made to the growth in net fees and commissions, which reached $€ 503.1$ million, up $8.3 \%$ from the previous year.

Operating costs of the separate activity reversed the downward trend of recent years, increasing by $€ 404.5$ million in December 2022 compared to the same period of 2021. Despite the increase of $5.8 \%$ and $30.2 \%$ in administrative expenses and depreciation and amortisation, respectively, it was employee costs that was mainly responsible for the evolution in operating costs, with an increase of $€ 369$ million. However, the change in employee costs was strongly influenced by non-recurring factors in the amount of $€ 322.8$ million in 2022 and -€77.2 million in 2021. Of these, reference should be made to restructuring costs with the preemployment program in the 2 years, to the protocol relating to the medical plan in 2021 (-€145.3 million) and to the agreement for the transfer of responsibilities with the Pension Fund of CGD employees to Caixa Geral de Aposentações in 2023 ( $€ 245.8$ million). Thus, excluding the described extraordinary factors, employee costs of the separate activity in 2022 decreased by $€ 30.9$ million compared to 2021.

As a result of the aforementioned developments, net operating income before impairments stood at $€ 781.6$ million in 2022, an increase of $1.4 \%$ (up $€ 11.1$ million) when compared to 2021.

The decreases in provisions and impairments and in taxes, -€209.5 million and -€10.1 million, respectively, led to an increase of net income of the separate activity of December 2022, by $€ 230.8$ million (up $52.3 \%$ ). It

should be noted, however, that the change in provisions and impairments is also influenced by non-recurring factors, of which reference should be made to the reversal of $€ 60$ million, associated with the pre-retirement plan in 2022, while in 2021 there was a reinforcement of the impairment associated with this plan, in the amount of $€ 104$ million.

# Balance sheet 

CGD's net assets from separate activity reached $€ 90.756$ million at the end of 2022, which represented a decrease of $€ 5.6$ billion ( $-5.8 \%$ ) compared to December 2021. A decisive contribution to this change was from securities investments, which were down $€ 5.3$ million due to the sale of public debt securities and of other public issuers.

The cash and cash equivalents with central banks item reflects the strong liquidity position that CGD continues to enjoy. Reference should also be made to the evolution of loans and advances to customers, which were increased $€ 567$ million in 2022 (up 1.2\%) reflecting CGD's support for families and companies in Portugal.

On the liabilities side, the decrease observed in 2022 (down $€ 5.6$ billion) was essentially justified by the evolution of central banks' and credit institutions'resources (down $€ 6.4$ billion), as a result of the reimbursement of the ECB loans (third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations - TLTRO-III), within the scope of the Eurosystem's monetary policy measures, which totalled $€ 5.8$ billion.

Conversely, customer resources increased by $€ 3.8$ billion in 2022, reflecting the high rate of savings and customer confidence.

In the calculation of its separate own funds and prudential ratios reported to the supervisor at 31 December 2022, a net profit of around $€ 318.3$ million was considered in conformity with the ECB's authorisation under no. 2 of article 26 of regulation (EU) no. 575/2013 and article 5 of decision (EU) 2015/656 of the European Central Bank of 4 February 2015 on the inclusion of interim or year-end profits in common equity tier 1, which amount was calculated on the net accounting profit of around $€ 672.3$ million, net of approximately $€ 354.0$ million for the maximum distributable dividend in accordance with the preceding year's dividend payment ratio (implementation of decision (EU) 2015/656 of the ECB - conditions under which credit institutions may include interim or year-end profits in common equity tier 1).

## Main aggregates contributing to the annual change of the separate CET1 ratio

The change in terms of the CET1 ratio between December 2021 and December 2022 derives a twofold benefit from the combined effect of the increase in own funds and reduction of risk weighted assets (RWA):

- CET1 funds were up by around $€ 211.0$ million. This represents a 64 basis points (bps) increase in the CET1 ratio and essentially derives from the contribution of the following components:
- Net profit of around $€ 318.3$ million calculated in own funds was the main component making a positive contribution in accounting for an increase of 97 bp of the change in terms of the CET1 ratio;
- An increase of around $€ 169.4$ million in other reserves and retained earnings which resulted in an increase of around 51 bp of the change in terms of the CET1 ratio;

- A change of around $€-106.6$ million in revaluation reserves which translated into an impact of around -32 bp on the change in terms of the CET1 ratio;
- The increase in the deduction related to the pension fund surplus (notwithstanding, the decrease in the value of the asset was more than offset by the reduction in liabilities, contributing to an increase in the funding surplus over 2021) of around $€-100.3$ million which resulted in a -30 bp change in terms of the CET1 ratio, and
- The increase of around $€ 52.5$ million in the deduction of deferred tax assets (for tax losses) with an impact of -16 bp on the change in terms of the CET1 ratio.

The impacts of the change in net profit and the pension fund surplus on the above referred to CET1 ratios, reflect the effects of the liquidation operation on CGD's pension fund owing to the transfer of liabilities to CGA (Caixa Geral de Aposentações).

- Between December 2021 and December 2022, there was a reduction of around $€ 478.7$ million in RWA, with an impact of 30 bp in terms of the CET1 ratio. This change is mainly explained by the following factors:
- Reduction of exposure to investment units in funds, with a contribution of $€ 346$ million to the decrease in RWAs ( +21 bp in terms of the CET1 ratio);
- Reduction of exposure to derivatives contributing to a decrease of $€ 330$ million in RWA ( +20 bp in terms of the CET1 ratio);
- Decrease in the non-performing assets portfolio with a global contribution of $€ 264$ million to the reduction of RWA ( +16 bp in terms of the CET1 ratio);
- Decrease in the volume of investments in credit institutions contributing to a $€ 168$ million decrease in RWA ( +10 bp in terms of the CET1 ratio);
- Growth of the housing loan (mortgage) portfolio of domestic activity with an impact of $€ 206$ million on RWA ( -12 bp in terms of the CET1 ratio);
- An increase of $€ 242$ million in RWA for operational risk with an impact of -15 bp in terms of the CET1 ratio.

# CGD employees' Pension Fund and Healthcare Plan 

According to actuarial calculations carried out on a going concern basis, CGD's pension liabilities for its employees amounted to $€ 2,772.6$ million, at 31 December 2022. This amount was down $€ 527.1$ million over the $€ 3,299.6$ million euros, reported at 31 December, 2021.

Based on the value of the fund's assets, liabilities for the pension plan, at the end of 2022, had a coverage ratio of around $119.3 \%$ ( $100 \%$ for retirees and $146.7 \%$ for working employees). The pension fund's effective yield was less than expected, leading to a negative income deviation of around $€ 294$ million. CGD also made an actuarial profit on liabilities of around $€ 578$ million, as detailed in items 34 and 36 of the notes to the financial statements. Negative actuarial deviations associated with pension liabilities at the end of the year totalled around $€ 469.8$ million (against $€ 753.5$ million in 2021).

Based on a going concern approach CGD updated its discount rate from 1.35\% in December 2021 to 3.60\% in December 2022, owing to those interest rate movements in international markets which determine the various reference rates used to update actuarial liabilities. Following a long period of falling interest rates on international markets, particularly in the case of risk-free issuers, a phenomenon of rate increases was observed from the second half of 2021 and was very pronounced across 2022, owing to an inflationary macroeconomic environment. The constraints on economic activity and global trade deriving from the pandemic were accentuated by the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, reflecting a significant across-theboard growth of international raw material prices.

Reference should also be made to the fact that in addition to the evolution of the military conflict in Ukraine, the way markets are reacting to the fiscal policies of the major European economies and the monetary policies of central banks has led to a significant increase in the volatility of short term reference rates. As such, CGD has set a discount rate that was slightly lower than the main benchmarks, as a mitigating factor for the situation deriving from the effects observed in the market.

The assumptions on the wage and pension growth rate were also revised upwards, particularly for 2023, as a result of the above referred to constraints on economic activity in 2022 that impacted the Portuguese economy, increasing uncertainty and higher inflation rates, particularly in terms of energy and food components.

CGD considers that it is possible to maintain the wage growth rate over the long term, i.e. at $0.9 \%$, after 2024, as a threshold used in the June 2022 actuarial calculation and that, at the time in question, was in line with the most conservative market assumption. However, in view of the scenario of uncertainty and conservative approach that has characterised CGD's respective policy, it was decided to incorporate a 50 bp margin on the referred to wage growth rate to accommodate the risk of future deviations, resulting in the use of a wage growth rate assumption of $4.4 \%$ for 2023 and $1.4 \%$ in the following years.

Based on the same approach to the assumption for the pensions growth rate, i.e. using a margin of 50 bp to accommodate potential deviation risks - a rate of $3.9 \%$ was set for 2023 and $1 \%$ for subsequent years.

Contrary to the trend observed in the years 2020 to 2022, which were highly affected by the pandemic and whose future effects are still unclear, CGD also continued, on a level of mortality rates, to take a conservative approach to the calculation of its liabilities for post-employment benefits, by adopting the following mortality tables in June 2022, which reflected an increase in average life expectancy in comparison to the previous rates:

|  | $31-12-2021$ | $31-12-2022$ |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Mortality tables |  |  |
| Men | TV 88/90 | TV 88/90 (-1 year) |
| Women | TV 88/90 (-3 years) | TV 99/01 (-2 years) |

|  | Fund's <br> Management 2021 |
| :-- | --: |
| Amount of the Pension Fund on 31.12.2021 including liabilities | $3,558.7$ |
| Employees' contributions | 17.7 |
| Company 's regular contributions | 29.8 |
| Pensions paid | -81.3 |
| Net yield of Fund | -218.0 |
| Amount of the Pension Fund on 31.12.2022 including liabilities | $3,306.9$ |

At 31 December 2022, according to the fund manager's calculations, the fund was worth $€ 3,306.9$ million. This amount was sufficient to cover the minimum mandatory funding required by the current regulation governing this category of liabilities, i.e. the need to cover $100 \%$ of liabilities for retirees and at least $95 \%$ for working employees.

An amount of around $€ 38.3$ million was recognised in the employee costs account in the period, $€ 30.3$ million of which relative to the normal cost for the year, around $€ 10.3$ million for increased liabilities on early retirements, and $€ 2.3$ million resulting from gains associated with mutually agreed terminations.

The evolution of (accrued) actuarial deviations directly recognised in equity from a negative $€ 753.5$ million at the end of 2021 to a negative $€ 469.8$ million in 2022, is essentially explained by the favourable deviation of $€ 578.2$ million associated with liabilities, mitigated by the negative actuarial deviation of around $€ 294$ million in pension fund yield.

The yield on CGD's pension fund was $-6.03 \%$. Details on the composition of the portfolio are given in items 34 and 36 of the notes to the financial statements.

The evolution of retirement pension liabilities and contributions over the last five years was as follows:

# PENSION LIABILITIES FOR RETIREES 

(EUR million)

|  | 2019 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2020(1) |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Pension Liabilities | 2,740.1 | 3,226.0 | 3,429.8 | 3,299.6 | 2,772.6 |
| Contributions to the Pension Fund | 190.9 | 359.0 | 67.7 | 55.7 | 29.8 |
| Regular | 61.7 | 58.0 | 67.7 | 55.7 | 29.8 |
| Extraordinary - recorded in liabilities | 129.2 | 221.5 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| Extraordinary - delivered the same year | 0.0 | 79.5 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |

(1) For 2022, the liabilities presented were calculated under the going concern assumption.

CGD transferred all pension fund liabilities to Caixa Geral de Aposentações in 2023, having extinguished and liquidated the fund and paid financial compensation for the liabilities transferred to it (as described on page 106).

The following table shows that the liabilities for CGD employees' post employment medical benefits at 31 December 2021 and 2022 were fully provisioned for the amounts of $€ 356.5$ million and $€ 309.2$ million, respectively:

## HEALTHCARE PLAN IN 2022 - PROVISION CHANGE

(EUR million)

|  | Provision |
| :-- | --: |
| Value of provision at 31.12 .2021 | 356.5 |
| Current cost for period | 10.2 |
| Contribution for healthcare services (SS and SAMS) | -21.3 |
| Actuarial gains | -36.2 |
| Value of provision at 31.12 .2022 | 309.2 |

The actuarial profit referred to in the table derives from a revision of the calculations of medical plan liabilities. The accrued actuarial deviations balance at 31 December 2022 amounted to $€ 130.5$ million.

# 1.5. Risk management 

The officer ultimately in charge of CGD's risk management function is its "chief risk officer" or "CRO", who is a member of the executive committee of CGD's board of directors. CGD's CRO has global responsibility for monitoring the group's risk management framework and particularly for ensuring the adequate and effective operation of the risk management function and is also responsible for providing information to and clarifying issues with the management and supervisory bodies on the risks incurred, CGD's and CGD group's global risk profile and level of compliance with the defined risk tolerance levels.

The risk management function in CGD group is based on a governance model that aims to comply with best practice on this matter, as set out in Community "Guidelines on Internal Governance under Directive no. 2013/36/EU (EBA/GL/2021/05) and to ensure the soundness and effectiveness of the system for the identification, measurement, monitoring, reporting and control of financial risks (credit, market, liquidity, balance sheet interest rate risk and pension fund) and non-financial (strategy and business, operational, IT and reputational) risks to which CGD group is or may be exposed.

Risk management is centralised and based on a dedicated structure comprising a risk management division which reports to the CRO. With the objective of incorporating the principle of separation between the owner functions of risk models and the assessment function on their quality, an independent structural body for the internal validation of the risk assessment models used in CGD group was set up in the form of the models validation office.

The risk management division operates in the management and control of CGD group's risk area, with the objectives of achieving stability, solvency and financial strength, ensuring the identification, assessment, measurement, oversight, control and reporting functions on the risks to which CGD group is exposed and the interrelationships among them, to ensure the coherent integration of their part contributions and that they remain in line with the risk appetite statement defined by the board of directors and will not significantly affect CGD's financial situation, continually ensuring compliance and conformity with external standards and respective legal and statutory requirements. It ensures the implementation of CGD's business continuity strategy based on the global coordination and planning of the respective activities and the supervision of such matters in group entities, in addition to mentoring a culture of continuity of group business. It coordinates the performance of transversal exercises, within the framework of regulatory processes or as part of internal initiatives. It controls and ensures the resolution of internally and externally identified recommendations, helping to improve the effectiveness of the internal control system and disseminates information on and improves the risk culture across CGD group as a whole, increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of risk management across the various group entities.

This information is complemented in chapter 3 on corporate governance where seeks to provide details on the risk governance model within the group in addition to its respective risk policy as set out in its risk appetite statement, providing the market with more detailed information in the sphere of CGD's risk framework.

## Main developments in 2022

The year 2022 was marked by several challenges inherent to the current macroeconomic environment of high uncertainty resulting from the war caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the increase in the price of energy, raw materials, foodstuffs, disruption of supply chains and global production resulting in an increase in inflation and consequently interest rates. In effect, in its sphere of action, the risk management division has ensured the monitoring of the effects of the current macroeconomic environment on CGD's (and the Group's) activity, including periodic sensitivity analyses, considering various macroeconomic scenarios for the assessment of impacts on the level of impairments and capital requirements, and the implementation of various periodic internal reports.

In April 2022 measures were approved for the Companies most vulnerable to the increase in energy costs and in December 2022 measures were also approved under the Operational Plan for the Households most vulnerable due to the rise in Euribor (within and outside the scope of decree law n880-A/2022).

Work continued throughout 2022 on the embodiment of the new Companies Platform (decision workflow) as one of the means of achieving the objective of clearly strengthening Immediate Decision. For the Individual Customers segment (mortgage loans and credit cards) and to achieve the same objective, a collection of improvements/automatisations in the risk algorithms was also approved, always maintaining the sector's good practices and all of CGD's risk principles.

The year 2022 was also marked by the updating of the regulations of all the Units abroad (Internal Credit Regulations/Guidelines).

The European Central Bank conducted two supervisory exercises related with climate and environmental risks in 2022, namely the Climate Stress Test and a thematic assessment on banks' alignment with supervisory expectations as well as the strength and scope of their respective plans to strengthen governance and strategy for managing such risks. CGD's results in both years were highly positive, positioning the institution above the average performance of its peers.

The results of the climate stress test show that Caixa Geral de Depósitos was above the average of the 104 banks that participated in this exercise, with a score of 2 (Medium-advanced), where around 65\% of the banks, had scores of 3 (Medium) or 4 (Underdeveloped) in relation to their climate stress test framework, confirming the importance that Caixa Geral de Depósitos has given to combating climate change and the progress that it has been making in this regard.

The risk management division continued to implement the new risk management strategic plan for 20222024, over the course of the year, as part of CGD Group's strategic plan to position CGD as a benchmark operator in the domestic banking system.

# Solvency risk 

Solvency risk comprises the risk of negative impacts on profit or equity resulting from changes to regulatory or fiscal frameworks, including the risk of mismatches between capital adequacy and risk profile.

Solvency risk, formalised in the last revision of the classification of CGD group risks, comprises fiscal, regulatory and internal capital risk areas.

## Methodology

Reference should be made, in terms of the oversight of solvency risk, to the regular monitoring of the adequacy between own funds and the risk profile, on a level of the prudential consolidation perimeter.

## Regulatory capital requirements

From a regulatory viewpoint, this oversight comprises the regular measurement of regulatory capital requirements for Basel Pillar I risks: credit, market and operational risk.

Risk weighted assets (RWAs) at the end of 2022, amounted to €43,363 million of which $87 \%$ related to credit risk, $9 \%$ to operational risk and the remainder to market risk

For the calculation of credit risk requirements, CGD group has implemented the standardised approach as defined in chapter 2, heading II, part III of regulation (EU) no. 575/2013.

This methodology consists of segmenting the original risk positions into the risk (i.e. exposure) classes defined in article 112 of the referred to regulation. The positions are subject to impairment value adjustments to obtain the risk positions.

Taking into account the guarantees and sureties associated with the positions, the referred to regulation provides for the application of risk reduction techniques for reclassification purposes (personal protection) and/or reduction (real protection) of the positions at risk. The risk positions are weighted according to their final exposure class (after any reclassification) as defined in chapter 4, heading II, part III of the referred to regulation.

For positions at risk in the case of sovereigns, public sector entities, companies, institutions and collective investment undertakings (funds) the supervisory body allows the risk weighting factor to be determined on the basis of credit quality assessments attributed by external credit assessment institutions (ECAIs) it considers eligible (regulation (EC) no. 1060/2009).

For derivatives, repurchase operations, loans contracted for or issued on property or commodities, long term settlement operations and loan operations with the imposition of a margin, the standardised approach for measuring counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR) as defined under regulation (EU) no. 876/2019 of the European Parliament and of the Council has been applied since June 2021.

Own funds requirements for the trading portfolio are calculated by applying the standardised approach to debt, capital and foreign exchange instruments and, lastly, the own funds requirements for operational risk

are calculated on the three-year average of the relevant risk-weighted indicator calculated in each year for each of the activity segments as defined in the same regulation using the standardised approach.

Based on the results of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP), in 2022, CGD should ensure (in 2023) on a consolidated basis a total ratio (TSCR) of $9.90 \%$ (of which additional own funds requirement of Pillar 2 (P2R) of $1.90 \%$, to be held at least in the form of $56.25 \%$ of CET 1 instruments and $75 \%$ of Tier 1 instruments). It should be noted that, compared to 2022, the Pillar 2 requirement defined for CGD shows a reduction of $0.1 \%$, thus reflecting an improvement in the supervisor's perception of the institution's overall risk.

The "Market Discipline 2022" document, scheduled for publication in first half 2023, will provide detailed information on CGD group's regulatory capital requirements, calculated in the three risk areas.

# Internal capital requirements 

In the sphere of Basel's Pillar II, CGD group carries out an internal capital adequacy assessment (ICAAP) exercise, which aims to identify, measure and allocate capital to the risks to which the banking group is or is likely to be exposed.

The risk identification and measurement process focuses on all risks defined in CGD group's risk classification system. In turn, according to the perception of the materiality of the risks, internal methodologies and/or risk factors are used to quantify the internal capital needed to absorb unexpected losses resulting from risks that may materially affect CGD group, broken down by risk categories and, when applicable, sub-categories.

Taking into account that that the identification of internal capital needs should support strategic decisionmaking while, at the same time, aiming to maintain adequate capitalisation on an operational level, the corporate policy on the use of internal capital, published in 2020, formally instituted the use of internal capital to support CGD group's and its entities' decision-making processes.

As such and in accordance with the approved framework and risk appetite statement, the assessment of internal and regulatory capital adequacy focuses on the planning that supports the implementation of the group's strategy. Short and medium term planning for capital and capital needs are prepared in the context of the normal (base) scenario but also considers a macroeconomic environment and adverse idiosyncratic events, allowing the assessment of CGD group's solvency position when subject to extreme scenarios.

In the context of solvency risk, compliance with the regulatory exposure limit to a customer or group of customers related on the basis of controlling or economic dependency relationships is also assessed. Under part IV of the CRR, the amount of exposure to a customer or group of related customers, net of impairment and exemptions provided for in the regulation, may not exceed $25 \%$ of eligible own funds.

The leverage ratio is also calculated and monitored. The leverage ratio is a regulatory and supervisory instrument calculated on the division of a measure of own funds (tier 1 capital), by a total exposure measure whose calculation rules are set out in part VII of the CRR and Commission delegated regulation (EU) no. 2015/62.

## Credit risk

Credit risk is associated with the losses and degree of uncertainty over a customer's/counterparty's capacity to meet its obligations.

Given the nature of banking activity, credit risk is particularly important, owing to its materiality, notwithstanding its interconnection with the remaining risks.

Credit risk is managed and controlled by internal regulations that, based on the use of a rating/scoring system and exposure level, an early warning system and classification of customers as being in financial distress, define the necessary levels of authority for the decision to issue a loan.

Credit and credit risk control portfolios, including compliance with the criteria defined for credit risk decisions are regularly monitored by DGR, based on operational systems which identify events of deterioration in the quality of credit risk on a daily basis, in addition to events that trigger automatic credit markers on credit restructured on account of financial distress or defaults/non-performing exposures. Reports making reference to the performance and perceived quality of the credit portfolio are produced in the following areas i) new credit agreements, ii) credit which has been restructured owing to a customer's financial difficulties, iii) non-performing exposures, iv) default and v) concentration. These reports are submitted for the consideration of the management bodies and shared with the first line of defence.

Also related to default and the valuation of credit assets, a process for determining impairment losses, overseen by the management body on a monthly basis in accordance with IFRS 9 has been implemented in CGD group, The criteria and methodologies used to calculate impairment are subject to control and audit processes both by the internal bodies responsible for the validation (models validation office and internal audit division) and CGD's external auditors who produce an independent report to be sent to the Bank of Portugal every six months. DGR, on a monthly basis, provides management bodies with information on the evolution of provisions and impaired credit, including portfolio evolution by IFRS 9 stages and their respective level of provisioning and impairment.

The Credit Risk Division (DRC) is a top-level body within CGD's organic structure, with a corporate scope, with functions of risk analysis, issuing opinions and deciding on credit operations, in accordance with credit and of delegation of competences in force, and it is also responsible for assigning and validating credit exposure limits, monitoring defined credit alerts and approving the constitution / alteration of Economic Groups in accordance with the regulations in force.

DRT (rating and internal control division) performs a corporate function which is independent from business areas and is responsible for attributing credit ratings to all segments having a relationship with CGD group, ensuring that all exposures are noted and permanently updated, providing an adequate description of customer credit risk. It is also responsible for ensuring the adequacy of rating models (quantitative and qualitative) in addition to, bearing in mind its corporate function, ensuring the harmonisation of policies and ratings attribution processes on a CGD group level.

# Methodology 

![img-27.jpeg](img-27.jpeg)

- Risk analysis - CGD group has established a system for the identification, assessment and control of risk on its credit portfolio, encompassing all customer segments and active both at the time when the credit is issued as in the monitoring of risk across the lifetime of the operations.
- All credit operations, upon origination, must be economically viable, be of interest to CGD, in accordance with its credit policy and affect own funds in compliance with the defined solvency ratio, in light of, namely: (i) their purpose and specific conditions of the real operations they aim to finance, (ii) the suitability and business, technical and financial capacity of their proponents and respective representatives and (iii) their former relationship with CGD group and the financial system in general, in addition to the global amount of their liabilities to the group and the financial system.
- The amount and maturity of each operation should be commensurate to its type and purpose and the material conditions of the real underlying operation.
- The conditions of each credit operation, in matters of guarantees and interest rate, should be defined on the basis of the level of credit risk involved and a customer's global relationship with CGD group, always bearing CGD's credit policy in mind. Real, or equivalent, guarantees are normally required for medium/long term operations.
- For corporates, municipalities, autonomous regions and financial institutions with a more significant level of exposure, or with other added risk criteria/triggers, consideration of credit risk, in addition to being supported by internal rating models (including both financial and qualitative

information), is individually examined by a team of analysts which produces credit risk analysis reports and issues an opinion on the inherent credit risk. This individual analysis includes (i) consideration of diverse, up-to-date information (forthwith, exposure to CGD group and the rest of the banking system, rating(s), information on defaults and incidents, fiscal liabilities and amounts owed to the social security services, pledges, judicial actions, etc), (ii) an assessment of managerial capacity, (iii) consideration of the proposal's reasonability, (iv) an assessment of the repayment capacity of the proponents/projects, adjusting the repayment profile when the risk is considered manageable, and (v) consideration of risk mitigating factors (guarantees, covenants, etc). The analysis is always produced on the basis of the economic group to which the proponent belongs and, starting from a certain exposure level, the analysis teams adopt a specialised sectoral approach.

- The assessment of corporate credit and project finance risk already includes environmental and social considerations:
- The credit risk assessment in the case of project finance includes, in the analysis of each project, a category referring to sustainability and a project's socio-environmental impact, with the aim of analysing the project finance's different intervention domains, based on four essential areas: economic profitability, financial viability, social equity and environmental correctness;
- The assessment of corporate credit risk is also based on considerations regarding a company's social and economic credibility, firstly through the ESG Rating;.
- CGD Group's project finance portfolio particularly concentrates on projects in the Iberian Peninsula. The safeguarding of a collection of environmental and social obligations is embedded in such countries' legislation and compliance therewith by the respective economic agents is mandatory.
- Credit risk assessment in the retail segment is based on the use of statistical risk assessment tools (PD - probability of default), by a collection of internal regulations which establish objective criteria on lending operations to be complied with and the delegation of authority in accordance with the ratings on customers/proposals. Only in the case of loans to personal customers is this complemented by a scoring system on the operations which is used to define credit limits by product, in terms of an immediate decision (operations with standard risk parameters).

In 2023, the Credit Risk Division, following its ambition inherent in the Strategic Plan 21-24, will continue the path of modernising the current process and optimising the Credit Decision, always in strict compliance with the best practices and risk principles/guidelines of the sector.
(7) The credit impairment model developed by CGD group, under IFRS 9, enables expected losses (i.e. impairment) to be measured on the basis of borrowers' creditworthiness and amount of existing collateral, based on the allocation of credit to the following macro segments:

- Stage 1 - Performing credit, without any signs of a significant deterioration of credit risk;
- $\quad$ Stage 2 - Performing credit, but in which criteria indicating a significant deterioration of credit risk have been identified. This segment includes operations which have been restructured owing to a customer's financial difficulties but which have not activated default criteria;
- $\quad$ Stage 3 - Credit in default.

The risk factors used in the credit impairment model ( 12 month PDs, lifetime PDs, LGDs, etc...) are revised annually and backtested with point-in-time adjustments to ensure that they adequately reflect market conditions.

The macroeconomic scenarios supporting the forward-looking aspect of risk factors are updated twice a year by CGD's economic research office, based on the most recent macroeconomic projections, such as those published by the IMF and Bank of Portugal, at the close of each half year. The impairment calculation considers three macroeconomic scenarios (favourable, central and adverse), whose weighting is defined by CGD's economic research office.

The credit impairment model continues to be governed by collective and individual impairment concepts as described below:

- Collective impairment analysis - expected losses per risk sub-segment are assessed on exposures which are not considered to be individually significant. They include, inter alia, assets with similar risk characteristics (credit segment, type of collateral, payments history, ratings and scoring models);
- Individual impairment analysis - an individual assessment is made on customers with exposures considered to be individually significant. The process involves CGD's and DRC's commercial areas, and credit recovery areas with the risk management area being ultimately responsible for the procedure and final assessment as a whole.

CGD's individual analysis methodology takes the following into account:

- Going concern approach (an active company whose liquidation is not foreseeable). The debtor will continue to generate operating cash flow that may be used to repay debt to all creditors. The collateral may also be considered to the extent that it does not influence operating cash flow;
- Gone concern approach (a company in liquidation or at risk thereof). The collateral is called in and the entity ceases to have any operating cash flow.

In the context of an individual impairment assessment of highly exposed customers, the analysis essentially focuses on the following:

- Compliance with the contractual conditions agreed with CGD group;
- Assessment of the current and prospective economic-financial situation;
- Prospects for the evolution of a customer's activity;
- Verification of the existence of operations with overdue credit and interest in CGD group and/or the financial system;
- Adequacy of guarantees and collateral for credit mitigation purposes;
- Analysis of historical information on a customer's good payment record.

For significant individually assessed exposures in which no objective impairment situations have been identified, collective impairment is determined in accordance with risk factors on loans with similar characteristics.

As a result of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, which contributed to aggravating the rise in energy prices that had been felt since 2021, which allied to constraints still being felt in the production and supply chains, as well as the rise in inflation and interest rates, CGD implemented additional credit risk assessment processes.

The new processes implemented aimed to identify potential risks of default or a significant deterioration in credit risk supported by prospective analyses considering various macroeconomic scenarios and assessment of the pandemic's impacts on different sectors of activity more exposed to rising energy prices or in customers who still have weaknesses from the Covid-19 pandemic.

As a result of these analyses, a corporate operational plan, with the following objectives, was defined:
a) Identification of customers potentially more vulnerable to increases in energy prices, inflation and interest rates, as regards their economic-financial capacity and normal debt servicing capacity;
b) Individual appraisals have been carried out for this purpose, based on forward-looking information, on a significant number of corporate customers;
c) Redefinition of credit decision rules regarding the definition of rejection limits based on an internal risk level (rating) in conjunction with the sector's vulnerability to rising energy prices;
d) Activation of stage 2 or stage 3 ratings based on an unlikely-to-pay analysis, deriving from the results of individual appraisals.
(2) Limits - CGD Group allocates internal credit limits to improve the flexibility of the process for short term lending to corporates and promotes the use of rigorous, uniform risk criteria, on the different parties involved. In parallel, in order to streamline and standardise the risk analysis of these operations, CGD Group has also

developed and implemented reference of a model for defining short term corporate exposure limits, based on economic-financial and sectoral indicators and credit ratings that provide guidance on the recommended short term exposure level to each customer. The model allows the use of the same set of clear, objective rules for the calculation of reference limits, which are indicative only.

Internal limits for the financial institutions segment have also been approved. The definition of such limits takes into account an entity's status in the financial sector vis-à-vis its peers, rating, VaR and other relevant elements.

Compliance with limits, credit exposures, counterparty and group risk profiles are subject to the regular oversight of credit risk analysts.
(1) The credit portfolio's composition and corresponding quality is overseen and analysed In the credit risk control and monitoring sphere. Three monthly reports are produced for this purpose to include the following; i) Evolution of impaired credit, provisions for off-balance sheet exposures and impairment on non-current properties held for sale. This report evaluates the migration of stages by portfolio segment; ii) Report on nonperforming exposures allowing the oversight of the objectives drawn up to reduce this type of exposure on a CGD group level, enabling objective actions to be taken to achieve targets; iii) Report on the monitoring of credit portfolio quality; including an assessment of the quality of new credit, by rating, scoring and LTV levels, with oversight of the most significant exposures, in addition to oversight of specific KPIs.

Monitoring the performance of internally developed risk classification models is also particularly important. This follow-up, based on the processing of information on the use of the referred to models, provides indications on continued adequacy. The follow-up is undertaken by an independent modelling area hub in the risk management division enabling autonomous guidance to be provided on any needs to revise models and information on their use.
(2) Recovery - CGD also has two specialised oversight units: DAP (retail business monitoring division) and DAE (corporate business monitoring division) and a unit for the management and marketing of properties as payment acquired in the context of credit recovery - real estate business division (DNI):

# Oversight of individual customers 

## Framework

Retail business monitoring division (DAP) is responsible for the management and monitoring of Individual Customers, Individual Business Owners and Companies with exposure to CGD of less than 1 million euros, whose situation advises action measures aimed at the full regularization and recovery of loans granted, including those granted by Group Companies in the case of common customers.

Activity in 2022 focused on the following:
a) Follow-ups on customers with post moratoria measures as part of the debtors under surveillance project;
b) Increased automation, with an extension to low value-added activities;
c) Further improvement, adjustment and development of new Celonis functionalities as a tool for the analysis of oversight processes and end-to-end operational activity control;
d) Development of an action plan to comply with decree law $n^{\circ}$. 80A of 25 November - Support measures for customers with financial difficulties owing to higher interest rates.

## Activity in 2022

At the end of 2022, the portfolio comprised a total of 91,832 customers $(29,053$ at the negotiation and 62,779 at litigation stages), with an exposure of around $€ 1,316$ million, distributed as follows:

## PORTFOLIO EXPOSURE

- Negotiation (€682 million);
- Litigation (€634 million).

Global impairment on this portfolio, representing around $25.7 \%$ of the exposure of portfolio customers, was around $€ 337.9$ million. Around $29.2 \%$ ( $€ 98.7$ million euros) of such impairment was in the negotiation portfolio and $70.8 \%$ ( $€ 239$ million euros) in the litigation portfolio.As regards performance in 2022 and

notwithstanding the pandemic and its effects, it was possible to reduce the level of NPL s by $€ 171$ million ( $30 \%$ of the portfolio of NPLs under management in early 2022).

Considering the performing and non-performing portfolio, the total recovery in 2022 was 424 million euros. Collections ( 279 million euros) continue to be the main form of recovery, representing $66 \%$ of the amount recovered, cures dropped to just $12 \%$, around 51 million euros (note that the moratoriums and postmoratorium measures had the impact of suspending the curing periods during maintenance), we also had the sale of a portfolio of 61 million euros, which represented $14 \%$ of recoveries and finally the auctions and write-offs represented 21 million euros ( $8 \%$ ).

# Outlook 

In 2023, in addition to current portfolio management operations, there is also a special focus on the oversight of defaults and implementation of default prevention measures, not only by strengthening oversight actions on initial non-compliances but also and mainly on the prevention of default levels, highly focused on the implementation of the measures announced in decree law $n^{2} .80 A$ of 25 November, that will remain in force across the whole of 2023.

We shall continue to work with DGR on a review of the recovery model and possibility of expanding the predictive model created for debtors under surveillance to the whole of CGD's credit portfolio, enabling a proactive approach to restructuring solutions with pre-defined conditions in conjunction with the PARI (action plan for the risk of default) regime and shall also start work on the development of a recovery solutions model.

## Oversight of corporate customers

## Framework

The corporate business monitoring division (DAE) plays a key role in the oversight and recovery of nonperforming exposures in Caixa Geral de Depósitos and being responsible for monitoring and recovering the exposures of Companies, and respective groups, above 1 million euros. Also responsible for managing CGD's equity investments in corporate and real estate recovery funds.

The corporate business monitoring division has the following priority objectives:

- Monitor and recover credits granted to companies, and respective groups under its management;
- Deleveraging operations on large exposures and sectors of activity considered to be at risk;
- Close oversight of customers, seeking to prevent situations of potential non-compliance, whenever justified by early warning signs;
- To implement CGD's preferred solutions designed to achieve deleverage, increase collateral and, whenever possible, out-of-court recovery of loans, while, at the same time, seeking to help the respective companies regain a sound footing;
- To ensure the analysis and design of alternative out-of-court recovery solutions, through negotiation, including oversight of the activity/management of a company and/or corporate group;
- To promote articulation with other CGD divisions, incentivising flexibility in the treatment of processes, in order to expedite the implementation of a solution for each case;
- Seek preferential articulation with other banks, through the respective recovery departments in order to facilitate the negotiation process and obtain the best overall solution;
- To liaise and collaborate with CaixaBI in deleveraging operations on its customers;
- Whenever a negotiated solution cannot be achieved, to arrange for the corresponding judicial procedure on companies under its management, in order to maximise the amounts recovered by CGD/CLF, through the judicial process;
- To oversee CGD's equity stakes in recovery funds, namely corporate recovery funds and real estate recovery funds, with a focus on deleveraging CGD's participation in these funds.


## Activity in 2022

In its permanent quest to further the bank's strategic plan (PE21-24), in 2022, DAE has continued to focus on reducing NPLs and succeeded in deleveraging an amount of $€ 146$ million in NPLs (leasing and factoring

debts originating in CGD). The main components of this deleveraging process were cash recoveries (repayments and liquidations) and cures that, together, accounted for around $60 \%$ of global deleveraging.

DAE's operations also allowed it to release $€ 25$ million in bank guarantees and recover $€ 22.6$ million of writeoffs.

DAE, in line with CGD's strategy, sought to implement recovery solutions based on economic support measures in view of the economic climate in 2022 and particularly the energy and raw materials crisis already in existence in 2021, aggravated by the invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russia, in addition to interest rate hikes comprising events occurring at a time when the economy was still in its post-pandemic recovery phase.

DAE's main restructuring measures, in 2022, accordingly comprised increases in the maturity of financing and dilution of payments, to enable customers to meet their debt servicing commitments. In several situations in which companies' circumstances did not allow restructuring operations, debt repayments comprised the liquidating of collateral.

There were three individual credit disposals, in 2022 and a portfolio for the disposal of unsecured credits consisting of both DAE credit and DAP credit (Saturn portfolio) was launched on the market and expected to be completed in 1st quarter 2023.

With regard to recovery funds, it was possible to deleverage around $50 \%$ of the exposure to the funds in a competitive process encompassing the FRT, FLIT and FRE funds.

The legal office, oversaw and controlled 596 court cases involving 335 customers in 2022, distributed as follows:

# NUMBER OF PROCEEDINGS IN COURT - BY TYPE 

![img-28.jpeg](img-28.jpeg)

It should be noted that, in addition to monitoring exclusively litigation processes, the Litigation DAE also supports the Business Areas in their relationship with the courts, with regard to clients in PER or insolvency with recovery.

With regard to environmental issues, DAE continued to adopt all the sustainability measures assumed by CGD, namely in terms of the paperless strategy.

In December 2022, the portfolio amounted to around $€ 3.4$ billion.
As illustrated in the graphic below, debt under management is distributed among the negotiations area, with $€ 1.2$ billion under management, litigation with $€ 646$ million under management and CaixaBI with $€ 1.5$ billion under management:

![img-29.jpeg](img-29.jpeg)

It should be noted that the debt under management in the business follow-up portfolio includes 56 million euros in leasing and factoring and about 2.3 billion euros in written-off loans, on which the business followup portfolio maintains its focus on the recovery perspective.

The volume of credit under management is spread over a total of 656 case files, of which 462 are NPEs. Customers are distributed as follows: 316 case files in the negotiating area, 321 in the litigation office and 19 in CaixaBI.

Reference is made below to the relative proportion of the various sectors of activity, in terms of debt volume and number of case files in the corporate business portfolio in December 2022:

EXPOSURE BY SECTOR
![img-30.jpeg](img-30.jpeg)

CLIENTS BY SETOR

The activity sectors with the largest representation in the portfolio are Services, Construction and Industry, which together account for about $78 \%$ of the portfolio of companies monitored. The dispersion has been relatively stable over the years, as shown in the comparative table with the previous year.

| Exposure by Sector | 2021 | 2022 |
| :-- | --: | --: |
| Agri-food | $1.9 \%$ | $1.8 \%$ |

| Services | $35.9 \%$ | $34.6 \%$ |
| Transport | $2.2 \%$ | $2.1 \%$ |

# Real estate disinvestment 

## Background

The activity of the real estate business division involves the integrated management of real estate, supporting the strategy outlined for CGD group, in its issuance of real estate opinions in support of financing or acquisition decisions, oversight of operations to build up real estate collateral, as well as in the management and marketing of the properties to be divested, in order to minimise risk and maximise shareholder value

## Activity in 2022

In 2022 a low level of inflow of properties was maintained which, combined with a good sales performance, resulted in a stock reduction of about $32 \%$. Sales of around $€ 170 \mathrm{M}$ in gross book value, reinforcing the downward trend in the weight of non-current assets held for sale on the balance sheet.

At the same time, more than $60 \%$ of the sales were financed by CGD.
As regards the type of property, in addition to housing which maintained an excellent performance, in 2022 it was the logistics and retail properties which were most in demand.

In property risk analyses, it was the residential and hospitality sectors that recorded the greatest increase, both in number and value of property projects analysed.

## Market risk

Market risk translates into potential negative impacts on profit or loss or an institution's capital, including the impact of adverse exchange rate variations on the balance sheet currency position. It arises in this way unfavourable prices movements of portfolio assets and therefore derives from uncertainty over price fluctuations and market rates such as the prices of shares and indices or interest rate or foreign exchange, credit spreads in addition to the price of commodities and on the behaviour of the correlations between assets or risk factors. Market risk exists on instruments such as shares, funds, bonds, spot and forward foreign currency operations, interest rate, foreign exchange, shares/indices/baskets, commodities and credit derivatives. Exposure to this type of risk is therefore across-the-board to various categories: price, interest rate, exchange rate, credit rates, volatility and commodities. The market risk measurement and monitoring perimeter covers operations involving equity risk, with management partitions by geographic unit or portfolio. Market risk management aims to set the goalposts for potential losses and seeks to optimise the relationship between the level of exposure assumed and the expected benefits.

The financial markets front office, in which the financial markets division operates is responsible for the day-to-day management of market risk and respective performance of market operations. There is complete separation between functions involving the execution of market operations and respective risk control, with the risk management division being responsible for measuring, monitoring, controlling and analysing daily market risk reporting, as well as verifying compliance with the respective limits. The reliability of prices and rates, as one of the main guarantors of the quality of the measures and metrics obtained, is also provided for on a daily basis. The second main aspect of change, involving the rotation of positions, is also monitored daily and enables fortuitous operational events or changes in the profile of portfolios or their risk profile to be identified.

# Limits 

The practice of defining and monitoring diverse types of limits is extremely important in mitigating market risk. These global limits are submitted to the ALCO committee by the risk management division for discussion and approval. The management rules on each portfolio or business unit, defined for CGD group, include defensive limits on future potential losses in addition to limits to freeze effective losses. Market risk limits are therefore established in VaR metrics, stress tests and sensitivity indicators as well as limits regarding the type of authorised instruments, exposure or concentration limits, in addition to the definition of maximum admissible losses in the form of loss warnings, loss triggers or stop losses. This practice aims to preventatively classify market risk exposure in the sphere of the risk appetite framework.

The use of market risk and acceptable loss limits is measured, controlled and reported at least once a day. The operating procedures, when limits are exceeded, are perfectly explicit.

Specific management rules are also applied to CGD group entities' foreign exchange risk position with the definition of goalposts for the net open position, open position by currency and VaR consumption limits.

## Methodology

Value at Risk (VaR) is a measure of the loss of potential future value that, in normal market conditions, will be the higher amount of the loss assuming a certain level of confidence and a specific investment timeframe. The market risk management area has, since 2002, used the VaR measure to monitor the group's market risk which is, in several cases, complemented by sensitivity limits on variations in risk factors - basis point value (bpv) and duration for interest rates and other sensitivity indicators usually applied to options portfolios (commonly referred to as Greeks). VaR is assessed for all types of market risk (interest rates, shares, exchange rates and volatility), using the historic simulation method, whose confidence levels and investment timelines considered are contingent upon the objectives for holding the portfolios. No statistical distribution is therefore assumed in this measurement, in which past returns are considered for each risk factor with the application of a complete revaluation of the portfolio.

Two complementary market risk metrics continued to be applied in 2022 in the form of Expected Shortfall (ES) which aims to quantify the potential loss of value in adverse market conditions and Three Worst (3W) that aims to quantify potential portfolio losses in extreme conditions, corresponding to readings on the losses side of the empirical theoretical P\&L distribution.

Market risk metrics are complemented by assessments of the impact of the valuations of assets and derivatives in the event of the occurrence of extreme scenarios involving fluctuations of risk factors (i.e. stress tests).

Market risk metrics permit homogenous application considering the effects of the correlation between the various risk factors based on a complete revaluation of the portfolio.

Market risk management calculates and monitors these indicators on a daily basis, having designed a comprehensive VaR report structure comprising expected shortfalls, three worst scenarios, sensitivity analyses, results of internal stress tests, profitability indicators and their respective inclusion in the limits defined for each monitoring perimeter, covering all group entities with market risk exposure in their balance sheet trading, banking and currency portfolios.

Foreign exchange risk is separately controlled and assessed on a daily level in the case of domestic activity and for each of the branches and subsidiaries and monthly on a consolidated level for the group as a whole.

The VaR model is continuously put to the test, either through its day-to-day use or theoretical daily backtesting exercises, as well as a real monthly assessment of backtesting values for the most relevant management perimeters.

The number of exceptions obtained i.e. the number of times technical or clean losses exceed VaR, in addition to the conditional and unconditional coverage tests, enable the model's accuracy to be assessed and adjustment weighting measures to be introduced, if necessary.

The following are the minimum, mean and maximum VaR values in 2022 for the most relevant perimeters:

# MARKET RISK INDICATORS 

![img-32.jpeg](img-32.jpeg)

Market risk on the prudential trading portfolio was slightly up over the year at $€ 2.5$ million against $€ 4.4$ million in 2021, with an average value of $€ 3$ million. Market risk on managed portfolios has decreased, mainly through a reduced exposure to sovereign debt. The risk of the portfolios managed, in general the market risk decreased, essentially due to the reduction in duration combined with greater diversification of exposure to sovereign debt.

## Pension fund risk

The Group continued until December 31, 2022 to operate a defined benefit pension plan for the former and current employees of Caixa Geral de Depósitos SA, subject to certain conditions governing inclusion. This plan had been closed to new participants since 2012. The capacity to meet pension plan liabilities was hedged by the management of an assets portfolio whose strategy had been approved by the members' board of directors, under the management of an independent management entity. Regular contributions to the fund by the member and participants were also stipulated.

In this context, pension fund risk derived from mismatches between pension fund assets and liabilities. Such mismatches could arise from the depreciation of the market value of pension fund assets or from the increase in the estimated value of pension liabilities due to actuarial, demographic or market factors. Depending on the magnitude and reason for the mismatch, the CGD while member may had to make up for potential shortfalls or resolve deficiencies, in the form of extraordinary contributions to the pension fund.

This risk with the pension fund risk was monitored throughout the year in terms of the risk appetite statement, with monthly reporting to the executive and risk committees. The calculation monitors the deviations in value between the assets portfolio and the estimated value of liabilities, the evolution of the performance of the assets portfolio in addition to the prospective evolution of the liabilities discount rate, with the aim of mitigating possibly significant or at least, unforeseen mismatches.

On 2 February 2023, the council of ministers approved the extinguishing of the Fundo de Pensões de Pessoal da CGD (CGD's employees' pension fund) and the transfer to Caixa Geral de Aposentações (CGA) of the liabilities and the amount corresponding to such liabilities with reference to 31 December 2022. This operation enables CGD to fully reduce the levels of risk resulting from the volatility deriving from the size of the pension fund, nature of its assets and liabilities and the accounting and prudential treatment thereof in the bank's profit and loss statement and balance sheet.

## Balance sheet interest rate risk

Balance sheet interest rate risk is the risk incurred by a financial institution whenever, during the course of its activity, it contracts for operations whose financial flows are sensitive to interest rate changes. Put in different words it is the risk of the occurrence of a change in the interest rate associated with the mismatching of maturities and revision of interest rates between assets and liabilities held, with a decrease in yield or increase in financial cost.

The particular dichotomy, in the case of assets and liabilities held by credit institutions, between short, medium and long term fixed and variable-rate portfolios may also lead to interest rate risk as regards the risk of mismatches between refixing periods, base risk and yield curve risk, for which matters involving the assessment of interest rate risk in the banking portfolio should be closely monitored.

# Methodology 

The methodology used by CGD to measure this type of risk comprises an accounting (or short term) and economic (or long term) perspective and uses both simplified interest rate gaps (aggregating all assets and liabilities sensitive to change, in residual interest rate bands, thus obtaining the corresponding mismatches) and effective duration (estimated percentage change in the price of the financial instruments for a variation in interest rates of 100 bps ) and robust simulation technique models including earnings at risk metrics (impact of adverse interest rate variations on interest margin) and the economic value of equity at risk (impact of adverse interest rate changes on the economic value of equity).

The management and control of balance sheet and banking portfolio interest rate risk are based on a set of guidelines that include a definition of limits for variables considered to be significant on a level of exposure to this type of risk. The objective of compliance with these guidelines is to ensure that CGD, at any point of time, is able to manage the return/risk trade-off in terms of balance sheet management and that it is simultaneously able to define the most adequate exposure level and control the results of the different risk policies and positions assumed.

The information on which balance sheet and banking portfolio interest rate is measured and monitored is considered monthly at ALCO and executive committee meetings.

The following table sets out the interest rate gap (repricing gap) in CGD group's balance sheet at the end of 2022.

* Perimeter: Prudential Banking

The size of the exposure to interest rate risk in December 2022 continues to comply with the respective risk appetite level set out in CGD group's risk appetite statement, which ensures a controlled level of interest rate risk in line with its focus on retail/commercial banking. The 12 month cumulative repricing gap metric of $€ 21,386$ million is indicative of the levels of sensitivity of net interest income to adverse changes in interest rates in line with the group's risk appetite.

In the context of regulatory interest rate reporting risk commitments, the European Central Bank's supervisory model, in the framework of the SSM includes quarterly short term data collection exercises designed to provide the supervisor with complementary information for the supervisory review and evaluation process. The supervisor's requirements for banking portfolio interest rate risk include: i) a breakdown of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items into residual interest rate revision periods; and ii) sensitivity analyses on interest margins and the economic value of equity to parallel shocks of +200 bps on interest rates in addition to non-parallel shocks.

# Liquidity risk 

Liquidity risk involves the possibility of the occurrence of a gap or mismatch between flows involving monetary payments and receipts, generating an incapacity to meet undertakings, i.e. in this kind of situation an institution's reserves and cash equivalents are insufficient to honour its commitments at the time of their occurrence.

Liquidity risk in terms of the banking business can occur in the event of:

- Difficulties in resource-taking to finance assets, normally leading to higher costs in securing such finance but which may also imply a restriction on asset growth;
- Difficulties in promptly meeting obligations to third parties caused by significant mismatches between periods to maturity on assets and liabilities.Methodology.

The management and liquidity risk tolerance strategy is established in accordance with CGD group's risk appetite statement supported by three basic pillars:
a) Maintenance of a stable, sound and secure liquidity profile, ensuring the adequate capacity to provide for liquidity stress situations;
b) Maintenance of stable funding sources and an adequate liquidity buffer, by adopting a proactive, market-oriented approach enabling CGD's balance sheet structure to adapt to existing conditions;
c) Control of the risk exposure of the group's international entities and their continued independence in terms of both deposit-taking and capital adequacy.

## Methodology

Liquidity risk management in CGD group embraces several timeframes in order to ensure an adequate liquidity position at all times. The risk identification and measurement process includes a robust structure based on exhaustive projections of cash flows on the group's assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions and embraces several aspects which, inter alia include:
a) A rigorous, comprehensive liquidity risk measurement programme as part of the liquidity management strategy and CGD's contingency plans, comprising:
i. A pro forma methodology for measuring and reporting funding needs based on contractual and contingent cash flow projections;
ii. The maintenance of a stock of high quality, uncollateralised liquid assets that can be rapidly converted into cash in corporate markets, within a short period of time and without significant loss of value, during a period of liquidity stress;
b) A contingency funding plan measured on the basis of the results of liquidity stress test exercises and intended to be effective in managing any indication of funding and market liquidity risk;
c) The definition of internal limits and controls consistent with CGD's risk tolerance;
d) Risk-taking incentives in different business areas to ensure that they are aligned with the liquidity risk exposure intended for each institution, whether structural or contingent;
e) Managing access to a diverse collection of funding sources and maturities.

![img-33.jpeg](img-33.jpeg)

The measurement of an institution's liquidity involves, inter alia, an assessment of its receivables against its outgoings vis-à-vis the liquidity of its assets, to identify potential future net funding deficits. The structural liquidity concept is used for the analysis and definition of exposure limits and aims to incorporate the historical reaction of depositors in terms of the management of their current and savings accounts, distributing their balances among the different timeframes considered in accordance with in-house studies and models (note 42).

Liquidity risk management also incorporates stress tests in articulation with the existing liquidity contingency plan in conformity with the principles and recommendations announced by the BCBS (Basel Committee on Banking Supervision), CEBS (Committee of European Banking Supervisors) and EBA (European Banking Authority).

The internally developed methodology used to measure CGD's resilience to eventual liquidity difficulties encompasses the measuring and monitoring of the "survival period" (time remaining up until the occurrence of liquidity difficulties if corrective measures have not been implemented), based on three stress scenarios on a market level. A fourth scenario, in the form of the baseline scenario, is also considered on the assumption that CGD's activity will be performed in line with its budget and consequent funding plan.

The existing model also includes a set of minimum values for survival periods to be complied with in each of the referred to survival periods in each scenario. Non-compliance with any of the established limits presupposes the implementation of the contingency measures provided for in CGD's liquidity contingency plan, in accordance with the priority levels for the use of the different funding instruments therein defined.

In 2022, CGD maintained the set of mechanisms and metrics for measuring and monitoring liquidity risk to ensure the strength of the group's risk assessment framework, particularly:

- Liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). This is the minimum liquidity standard under the CRR/CRD IV regulatory framework;
- Net stable funding ratio (NSFR). This is mandatory from June 2021 under the framework of regulation (EU) no. 2019/876 and enables an assessment of institutions' reliance on stable funding. It should be more than or equal to $100 \%$ to ensure that the available funding meets the funding requirement within a one-year timeframe and is the ratio between the amount of stable funding available and the amount of stable funding needed.
- Additional liquidity monitoring metrics (monthly). This is a set of additional liquidity monitoring measures in accordance with sub-paragraph b) of number 3 of article 415 of regulation (EU) no. 575/2013. It includes quantitative data on i) concentration of funding by counterparty and type of product, ii) funding cost, iii) renewal of funding, and iv) concentration of counterbalancing capacity (net assets) by issuing entity/counterparty;

- Collateralisation ratio. This is the value of collateralised assets and the fair value of guarantees received and re-used vis-à-vis total assets and total guarantees received and available for collateralisation purposes;
- Internal liquidity adequacy assessment process (annual). This is a self-assessment exercise on the adequacy of credit institutions' liquidity levels that, in compliance with article 86 of directive 2013/36/EU, should have robust strategies, policies, processes and information systems for i) the identification, measurement, management and monitoring of liquidity risk across appropriate timeframes, and ii) the management and monitoring of funding positions in order to guarantee adequate liquidity buffer levels and an adequate funding structure;

CGD Group had a comfortable LCR of 3034\% at 31 December 2022. This was significantly higher than the minimum requirements (a ratio of more than 100\%) and confirms the Group's excellent liquidity position.

The Group's excellent liquidity position is also confirmed by its NSFR with a comfortable value of $182.6 \%$ at 31 December 2022. This ratio aims to promote the existence of a sustainable maturities structure between assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, with a required minimum of $100 \%$.

Across 2022, CGD, as usual, pursued a resource-taking policy designed to ensure a sustainable funding structure for its activity, based on the liquidity and residual period to maturity characteristics of its assets and off-balance sheet exposures.

# Non-financial risks 

## Operational risk

Operational risk comprises the risk of negative impacts on results or capital deriving from failures of analysis, processing or settlement of operations, internal and external fraud, use of subcontracted resources, internal processes involving the making of ineffective decisions, insufficient or inadequate human resources and situations of inoperability of infrastructures.

This risk is transversal to the development of various processes and is minimised through the implementation of adequate control and mitigation procedures.

In terms of the calculation of own funds requirements to cover its operational risk, CGD group has adopted the standard method on a consolidated basis, which is also used on a separate basis by Caixa Geral de Depósitos and Caixa Banco de Investimento.

The application of the standard method on a consolidated basis, at 31 December 2022, resulted in own funds requirements of $€ 288$ million.

## Methodology

Operational risk management in CGD Group uses an end-to-end methodology, based on a collection of guidelines, principles and regulations recognised as good practice on a national and international level.

This methodology, incorporating a series of components, has been implemented in CGD and its respective branches and subsidiaries, as follows:

- Definition and monitoring and reporting of risk tolerance and appetite limits for the whole Group;
- Identification of operational risks and respective controls, supported by the mapping of processes, analysis of new products and services and monitoring of activities carried out under subcontracting arrangements;
- Identification and analysis of operational risk events, losses and recoveries, reinforced and supported by control procedures;
- Self-assessment of potential operational risks and respective controls;
- Analysis of the impact of extreme scenarios;
- Definition and oversight of key risk indicators;
- Promotion of training programs and dissemination of information;

- Identification of internal control deficiencies and validation of the implementation of recommendations for mitigating the operational risk of internal control deficiencies;
- Identification, definition and implementation of action plans as a corollary to the remaining methodological components.

The methodology implemented in CGD Group is based on a corporate governance model and includes the disclosure of information through an internal reporting system that includes regular meetings of delegated councils/committees and the disclosure of reports to various Group structures.

In organisational terms, operational risk management in CGD is ensured by different structures/functions with specific responsibilities in this process and is coordinated by the risk management division's operational risk area.

This area also includes a structure dedicated to business continuity management, responsible for ensuring the management, maintenance and implementation of the respective initiatives.

The transition audit and external audit oversight action on the international benchmark standard on this issue in the form of ISO 22301:2019 - Societal security - Business continuity management systems Requirements, was carried out in September 2022. CGD continues to comply with the series of recommendations on business continuity management in the financial sector as defined in the Bank of Portugal's circular letter No CC/2021/00000047 in addition to taking the necessary steps to comply with the standard's specific requirements.

This renewed certification confirms that CGD's business continuity principles and good practice have been guaranteed and implemented and continue to be resilient and ready to respond to potential threats to its business.

The Group is responsible for ensuring the supervision of this matter with group entities and reporting to the regulatory and supervisory authorities.

In 2022, the easing of measures to combat the pandemic resulted in the gradual lifting of restrictions and allow CGD to resume the normal operation of various services

Notwithstanding the improvement of the epidemiological situation caused by Covid-19, CGD continues to oversee the evolution of the pandemic and will reassess the need for new measures and consequent activation of the contingency plan if justified.

# Other non-financial risks 

According to the CGD Group's risk taxonomy, non-financial risks in CGD group include four risks under its management: strategy and business, model, information technologies (IT) and reputational. Such risks consist of the likelihood of the occurrence of negative impacts on profit or loss or capital depending on the risk category, namely:

- Strategy and business risk: losses deriving from macroeconomic, geopolitical, business positioning and strategy, execution of investment, equity investments in banks and non-banking entities and climate and environmental change;
- IT risk: losses deriving from the risk of change, data integrity, IT system failures, cyber risk and access risk and the delivery risk of IT systems;
- Model risk: losses owing to decisions that can be made mainly on the basis of the results of internal models, owing to the occurrence of errors in the development, application or use of such models;
- Reputational risk: losses originating from a negative perception of CGD's public image (banking activity, bancassurance, asset management and risk of the protection of confidential data).

The main objective in the control and management of non-financial risks (other than those for which the specialised operational risk centre is responsible) is to identify, assess, measure, oversee, mitigate and report such risks, in which the identification and mitigation of risk sources is a priority for CGD regardless of whether they have given rise to actual losses.

# Methodology 

The supervision and control of non-financial risks is the responsibility of the governing bodies. The board of directors and the executive committee shall, in their management, include aspects relevant to the control and mitigation of non-financial risks on a periodic basis.

The non-financial risks governance model is established in conformity with CGD group's risk appetite statement which aims to adequately control all activities and processes in order to limit losses on nonfinancial risks, keeping them within the tolerance levels defined by CGD's board of directors, in addition to mitigating other relevant negative impacts, such as the level of achievement of strategic objectives, reputation or compliance with regulatory requirements.

One of the main elements of this methodology is CGD group's risk classification system, which uses a single, common language for the three lines of defence, within a framework of coordinated intervention between them and establishing a basis upon which CGD group can create an integrated approach to the management of all of its non-financial risks. According to the lines of defence model, the first line of defence consists of CGD's business and support areas and is responsible for identifying, assessing, mitigating, monitoring and reporting the risks identified in their respective spheres of activity. The second line of defence is responsible for ensuring the adequate development and implementation of a solid risk management and control model across CGD as a whole, independently, and the third line of defence comprises internal audit whose main objective is to identify any shortcomings or deficiencies which should be addressed by actions leading to their elimination or mitigation.

Although the maturity of the practices and the experience of the different types of non-financial risks differ widely, the non-financial risk management model incorporates an across-the-board set of components, such as:

- Promoting and supporting the development and continuous evolution of the non-financial risk management process and overseeing and assessing the defined strategies, policies and methodologies;
- Identifying the non-financial risks inherent to all of CGD's activities, products, processes and systems in addition to defining and monitoring its mitigation plans;
- Promoting the disclosure of information on non-financial risks to be duly taken into account in decisions made by the competent management bodies;
- Defining non-financial risk indicators and their risk appetite limits and monitoring their evolution;
- Identifying non-financial risks through the analysis of new products and services and oversight of subcontracted activities;
- Producing independent opinions to support decision-making processes and the first lines of defence in identifying non-financial risks;
- Participate in scenario analysis exercises, projections and stress tests;
- Promoting training programmes for the disclosure of information, incentivising the involvement of all employees;
- Reporting the findings of non-financial risk assessment tools, ensuring their quality and timeliness;
- Regularly participating in first lines of defence committees;
- Identify internal control deficiencies and validation of the implementation of recommendations for mitigating non-financial risks of internal control deficiencies;
- Identify and validate non-financial risk events and follow up action plans where applicable.

The incorporation of non-financial risks is being further developed into the operational risk management tool used by the first lines of defence and their respective control areas to maximise synergies between areas and permit alignment of the identified events with the respective action plans and deadlines is currently in progress.

To achieve the objective and consistent integration of the impact of ESG criteria (i.e. non-financial risks) in investment and funding decisions, a new ESG (environmental, social and governance) rating model on the

corporate and project finance segments was developed and implemented by DRT, in 2021, and which, in conjunction with traditional financial ratings, allows the definition of sustainable funding strategies to support the transition to a more sustainable economy.

# Objectives for 2023 

As in the recent past, 2023 is likely to continue to be a particularly challenging year for risk management areas. In this context, the following activities are considered to be the main objectives:

- Completion of the implementation plans defined for climate and environmental risks, for alignment with the expectations of the supervisors and best practice;
- Performance of the 2023 EU-wide stress test exercise;
- Participation in the design and implementation of an operational plan focused on customers exposed to the impact of energy costs, inflation and the war in Ukraine, in addition to the operational plan for compliance with decree law 80-A/2022 on the restructuring measures for mortgage loans for borrowers' permanent residence in response to interest rate hikes;
- Production of credit risk measurement models in entities (ratings across all entities and scorings for the main portfolios), models for the development of the climate risk management framework, together with other models of relevance to the business;
- Continued implementation of the new risk management function strategic plan for 2022-2024 as part of Caixa group's strategic plan;

# 1. Introductory note 

Caixa Geral de Depósitos, S.A. (CGD), founded in 1876, is an exclusively state-owned public limited liability company, with is headquartered at Av. João XXI, n. ${ }^{\circ}$ 63, 1000-300 Lisbon, Portugal. Caixa became a public limited liability company on September 1, 1993 under decree law 287/93 of August 20 which also approved its respective articles of association. Banco Nacional Ultramarino, S.A. (BNU) was incorporated into CGD on July 23, 2001.

CGD's operations at December 31, 2022 comprised a nationwide network of 521 branch offices ( 486 of which with face-to-face services and Caixa spaces, 3 mobile branches, 6 self-service branches and 26 corporate offices and extensions), a branch in France with 48 offices and a branch in Timor with 14 offices.

All amounts have been rounded up to the nearest thousand euros.
CGD also has direct and indirect equity stakes in a significant number of national and foreign companies in which it has controlling interests. They include Spain, Cape Verde, Angola, Mozambique, Brazil and Macau. These companies comprise Caixa Geral de Depósitos group (group) and operate in such diverse sectors as commercial banking, investment banking, brokerage, venture capital, real estate, asset management, specialised credit and cultural activities. CGD also has non-controlling equity stakes in companies in nonfinancial sectors of the Portuguese economy.

The consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2022 were approved by the board of directors on April, 20, 2023 and shall be submitted for the approval of the general meeting of shareholders which has the authority to amend them. The board of directors is convinced that they will be approved without any significant amendments.

## Strategic plan

The group, under the banner: "Building the Future", promoted the strategic initiatives needed to strengthen CGD's sustainability, in 2021, in carrying out the works leading to the preparation of the bases of its strategic plan for the period 2021-2024, to be implemented by a new board of directors, which was formally appointed in December 2021. The strategic plan was submitted for the consideration of Caixa's new board at the time of its appointment and was approved at the beginning of 2022.

The strategic plan for the referred to period has enabled CGD to embark upon a new cycle, focused on ensuring the group's provision of "universal" banking services, based on end-to-end digital processes to improve its service and provide its customers with more face-time. Based on training and improving the skills of its employees, CGD aims to make innovation a factor of differentiation in the market, together with a purpose genetically linked to a "green and sustainable" economy, with the end result of providing its state and private investors with adequate returns.

# 2. Accounting policies 

### 2.1 Presentation bases

The consolidated financial statements, at December 31, 2022 have been prepared on the basis of the international financial reporting standards (IFRS) as adopted in the European Union, in accordance with regulation (EC) no. 1606/2002 of July 19 of the European Parliament and of the Council and the provisions of decree law 35/2005 of February 17.

As referred to in note 14, the group reclassified the assets and liabilities of Banco Comercial do Atlântico (Cape Verde), in December 2022, to "Non-current assets and liabilities held-for-sale - subsidiaries" under IFRS 5 - "Non-current assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations". The income generated by this equity stake under this standard is also set out in a single line of the profit and loss statement ("Income from subsidiaries held-for-sale"), whose period has been accordingly re-expressed for comparison purposes. Information on the reclassification effect has been set out in the referred to note on an aggregate basis.

The accounting policies described in this note have been implemented on a consistent basis across all of the periods set out in the financial statements. Any exceptions have been identified.

### 2.2 Amendments to accounting policies

### 2.2.1 Voluntary amendments to accounting policies

There were no voluntary modifications of accounting policies in 2022, in comparison to those considered for the preparation of the financial information for the preceding year, which has been set out for comparison purposes. Neither have there been any changes in judgments or estimates for past years, or corrections of material errors.

### 2.2.2 New standards and interpretations for the period

Effective January 1, 2022 CGD adopted the following standards, interpretations, amendments or changes of relevance to its activity, as issued by the IASB and endorsed by the European Union:

- IFRS 16 (amendments) - COVID-19-related rent concessions after June 30, 2021. The amendments to the wording of the standard clarify that a lessee may exercise the option not to assess whether a COVID-19-related rent concession is a lease modification. If choosing to apply this expediency, they account for changes in rent payments resulting from a COVID-19 related concession in the same way as they would account for a change other than a lease modification, in accordance with IFRS 16, for payments originally due by June 30, 2022.

These amendments must be implemented in the financial years beginning on or after April 1, 2021.

- IFRS 3 (amendments) - "Business combinations". The amendments to the wording of this standard include:
(i) A correction of the reference to the applicable conceptual structure, which continued to refer to the version published in 1989, as opposed to the most recent version which was published in 2018;
(ii) The introduction of a clarification on the treatment of liabilities acquired as the result of a business combination, which should be processed under IAS 37 and IFRIC 21, when eligible under their sphere of application;
(iii) An explanation of the wording of the standard that states that an acquirer should not recognise contingent assets which have been acquired as the result of a business combination.

These amendments, whose effects are prospective, must be implemented in the financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.

- IAS 16 (amendments) - "Tangible fixed assets". The amendments to the wording of this standard clarify that any income earned from the use of an asset prior to its definitive installation on the location on which it is to be operated, in accordance with the conditions defined by management for its intended use, may not be deducted from the acquisition cost. An entity recognises the income obtained from the sale of such products and their production costs directly in profit and loss.

These amendments must be implemented in the financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2022. Retrospective implementation is only mandatory in the case of eligible assets which have been installed on their intended location after the date of the presentation of the first comparative period.

- IAS 37 (amendments) - "Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets". The amendments to the wording of this standard specify the accounting definition of eligible costs for classification as a sales contract. All costs which may be directly allocated to the fulfilment of contractual obligations, which may be incremental in nature (such as goods, equipment or fees) or on the basis of other types of allocation, provided that they are clearly identifiable (such as the depreciation costs of the equipment used to fulfil the referred to obligations) are considered for this purpose.

These amendments, whose effects are prospective, must be implemented in the financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2022. In the first year of implementation of the amendment, all contracts whose obligations have not been fully met by the date of presentation of the beginning of the first comparative period are included, without the need to re-express the comparison.

- Annual improvements to IFRS standards 2018-2020. The planned introduction of annual improvements for the period 2018-2020, considered non-urgent, but necessary, by the IASB, was published on May 14, 2020 and amends the wording of standards: IFRS 1, IFRS 9, IFRS 16 and IAS 41. Reference should be made to the following items which are potentially relevant to CGD's activity:
(i) IFRS 9 - This amendment clarifies the eligibility criteria for commissions to be considered by an entity in the sphere of the liabilities derecognition test in conformity with paragraph B3.3.6 of the standard ( $10 \%$ test). Only commissions paid or received between an institution (issuer of a financial liability) and an investor (or investors), including commissions paid or received for or on behalf of the other party are recognised.
(ii) IFRS 16 - This amendment eliminates the example of reimbursements of charges paid by the lessor on improvements to the leased asset from the wording of illustrative example no. 13 (text accompanying IFRS 16), as its wording was not considered to provide a correct and clear interpretation of the treatment of lease agreement incentives.

These amendments must be implemented in the financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.
The adoption of the referred to standards, interpretations, amendments and revisions did not have any significant equity impacts on the group's preparation of its financial statements for 2022.

# 2.2.3 New standards and interpretations to be implemented in future periods 

The following standards, interpretations, amendments and revisions, already endorsed by the European Union, must be implemented in future financial years:

- IAS 1 (amendments) and IFRS practice statement 2. The amendments to the wording of the standard and practice statement aim to clarify the requirements to be considered in assessments of accounting policies for disclosure purposes, substituting the expression "significant accounting policies" by "material accounting policies". This was also accompanied by the introduction of illustrative examples designed to demonstrate the application of the concept of materiality.

The amendments must be implemented in the financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2023 and are implemented prospectively.

- IAS 8 (amendments). The amendments to the wording of the standard differentiate between the presentation and disclosure of the different types of modifications of the financial statements, with the introduction of clarifications on the treatment of accounting estimates, and in particular:
- Measurement in a concept of uncertainty;
- Difference between modifications of accounting estimates and corrections of errors;
- Accounting for the effects of modifications of accounting estimates.

The amendments must be implemented in the financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2023.

- IAS 12 (amendments) - The amendments to the wording of the standard aimed to clarify how to account for deferred tax on transactions as leases. The amendments include an additional condition in which the exemption on the initial recognition does not apply. A temporary difference resulting from the initial recognition of a right-of-use asset or lease liability is not subject to initial exemption if the transaction gives rise to the same taxable, deductible temporary differences. It is only applicable if the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability gives rise to taxable, deductible temporary differences that are not the same.

The amendments must be implemented in the financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2023.
The following standards, interpretations, amendments and revisions, still not endorsed by the European Union, must be implemented in future financial years:

- IFRS 16 (amendments) - Amendments to the wording of the standard differentiate between the presentation and disclosure of different types of lease liabilities in terms of sale and lease.

This amendment to the standard on leases introduces guidelines on the subsequent measurement of lease liabilities related to sale \& leaseback operations that qualify as "sales" in accordance with the principles of IFRS 15 - "Revenue from contracts with customers", with a greater impact when several or all of the lease payments are variable lease payments that are not contingent upon an index or an interest rate. When subsequently measuring lease liabilities, vendors-lessees determine the "lease payments" and "revised lease payments" in such a way as not to recognise gains/(losses) in relation to the right-of-use retained by them. This amendment is implemented retrospectively.

The amendments must be implemented in the financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2024.

- IAS 1 (amendments) - The amendments to the wording of the standard clarify the classification of liabilities as current or non-current balances based on the rights to defer their payment at the end of each financial reporting period. The classification of liabilities is not affected by an entity's expectations as the assessment determines whether a right exists but does not consider whether or not an entity will exercise such a right, or by events occurring after the reporting date, such as non-compliance with a specific covenant. However, if the right to delay settlement for at least twelve months is subject to compliance with certain conditions after the balance sheet date, such criteria do not affect the right to defer a settlement for the purpose of classifying a liability as current or non-current.

The amendments must be implemented in the financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2024.
We do not consider that the adoption of the above standards, interpretations, amendments and revisions will have any equity impact on the group's preparation of its financial statements.

# 2.3 Consolidation principles 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CGD and those of entities controlled directly and indirectly by the group (note 3), including special purpose entities.

Under IFRS 10 - "Consolidated financial statements", the group considers that it wields control when it is exposed or has rights to the variable returns generated by a specific entity (referred to as a "subsidiary") and when it may, based on the application of the power retained by it and its capacity to superintend their relative activities, take control of them (de facto power).

The accounts of CGD group subsidiaries were consolidated by the global integration method. Significant transactions and balances between the consolidated companies have been eliminated. Consolidation adjustments are also made, when applicable, to ensure consistency in the implementation of the group's accounting principles.

The amount of third party investment in subsidiaries is recognised in "Non-controlling interests" in equity. In the specific case of investment funds included in the consolidation perimeter, any redemption options on the investments of holders of non-controlling interests are recognised at their equity value in "Other liabilities" (note 26) and their corresponding changes are recognised in the respective profit and loss account.

Consolidated profit comprises the aggregating of CGD's and its subsidiary entities' net profit, in proportion to their respective effective holdings, after consolidation adjustments have been made by eliminating dividends received and capital gains and losses made on transactions between companies included in the consolidation perimeter.

### 2.4 Business combinations and goodwill

Acquisitions of subsidiaries are recognised by the purchase method. The acquisition cost comprises the aggregate fair value of assets delivered, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed for achieving control over the acquired entity. The costs incurred in the sphere of the acquisition, when directly attributable to the operation, are recognised as costs for the period on the purchase date. Upon the acquisition date, which is the date upon which the group achieves control over the subsidiary, identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities meeting the recognition requirements of IFRS 3 - "Business combinations" are recognised at their respective fair value.

Goodwill is the positive difference between the acquisition cost of a subsidiary and the fair value attributable to its respective assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities on the purchase date. Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is not depreciated.

If the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired in the transaction exceeds their acquisition cost, the excess is recognised as income in profit and loss for the period.

The acquisition of non-controlling interests after control over a subsidiary has been achieved is recognised as a transaction with shareholders, upon which no additional goodwill is recognised. The difference between the value attributed to non-controlling interests and the respective acquisition cost at the transaction date is directly recognised as a charge to reserves. Similarly, the impacts of disposals of non-controlling interests when not entailing a loss of control over a subsidiary are also recognised in reserves. Profit or loss on disposals of non-controlling interests, when entailing changes in control over the subsidiary, are recognised by the group as a charge to profit and loss on the transaction date.

The group performs impairment tests on balance sheet goodwill at least once a year, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36 - "Impaired assets". For this purpose, goodwill is allocated to cash flow generating units whose respective recoverable value is based on future cash flow estimates at discount rates the group considers appropriate. Impairment losses on goodwill are recognised in profit and loss for the period and cannot be reversed.

Up to January 1, 2004, in conformity with the accounting policies defined by the Bank of Portugal, goodwill was fully deducted from shareholders' equity in the year of the acquisition of the subsidiaries. As permitted by IFRS 1 - "First-time adoption of international financial reporting standards" and as the group did not make any changes to this recognition, goodwill on operations, up to January 1, 2004, continued to be deducted from reserves.

Accounting of written put options on non-controlling interests
Liabilities resulting from written put options on non-controlling interests are initially recognised by the group as a charge to "Other reserves". Subsequent changes in the fair value of the put option measured on the basis of the agreed terms are also recognised as a charge to "Other reserves", except for the financing costs on registering the liability, which are recognised in "Interest and similar costs" in profit and loss.

# 2.5 Investments in associates and joint ventures 

Associates are entities over which the group wields significant influence but whose management it does not effectively control. Significant influence is presumed to exist whenever the group has a direct or indirect equity stake or voting rights of $20 \%$, unless it can be clearly shown that this is not the case. In parallel, significant influence is not considered to exist whenever the referred to equity stake is less than $20 \%$, unless the opposite, in this case, can also be clearly shown.

According to the requirements of IAS 28 - "Investments in associates and joint ventures", a significant influence by the group usually takes one of the following forms:

- A seat on the board of directors or equivalent management body;
- Participation in the process for defining policies, including resolutions on dividends or other appropriations;
- Occurrence of material transactions between associate and group;
- Rotation between members of management; and
- The supply of essential technical information.

There are also situations in which the group wields control over the activity of a company in which the equity stake is held in conjunction with other entities (joint ventures). This is usually structured on a basis of shared voting and similar decision-making rights.

Investments in associates and joint ventures are recognised by the equity accounting method, under which equity stakes are initially measured at their respective acquisition cost and subsequently adjusted on the basis of the group's effective percentage of changes in its associates' shareholders' equity (including their results). The equity accounting method is applied up to the time when the associate's or joint venture's accrued losses, when recognised by the group, exceed the investment's respective balance sheet value from which time it is discontinued, unless any legal or constructive obligation requires the creation of a specific provision to recognise such losses.

The equity of the companies used for the application of the equity accounting method is adjusted to reflect the implementation of the group's accounting principles in the case of differences with a materially relevant impact.

Unrealised profit or loss on transactions with associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the group's effective stake in the said entities.

# 2.6 Translation of balances and transactions in foreign currency 

The separate accounts of each group entity included in the consolidation are prepared in accordance with the currency used in the economic environment in which they operate ("functional currency"). Each entity's profit and loss and financial position is expressed in euros as the group's operating currency in the consolidated accounts.

In the preparation of its consolidated financial statements, foreign currency transactions are recognised on the basis of the reference exchange rates in force on the transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into each entity's functional currency at the exchange rate in force at each balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets at fair value are translated at the exchange rate in force at the last valuation date. Non-monetary assets carried at historical cost, including tangible and intangible assets, continue to be recognised at their original exchange rates.

Exchange rate profit/loss on translation is recognised in profit and loss for the period, except when deriving from non-monetary financial instruments at fair value, such as equity instruments upon which an option to classify them at fair value through other comprehensive income has been exercised and which are directly recognised in "Other reserves".

In the consolidated accounts the assets and liabilities of entities with a functional currency other than the euro are translated at the closing exchange rate, as opposed to income and costs which are translated at the average rate for the period. Under this method, exchange rate profit/loss is recognised in "Other reserves" in equity and the respective balance is transferred to profit and loss at the time of the disposal of the respective subsidiaries.

As permitted by IFRS 1 - "First-time adoption of international financial reporting standards", the group opted not to recalculate and therefore not recognise the impact of the translation of the financial statements of its subsidiaries expressed in foreign currency up to December 31, 2003 in "Other reserves". Accordingly, in the case of the disposal or closure of subsidiaries after the said date, only exchange rate profit/loss changes originating after January 1, 2004 will be reclassified to profit and loss for the period.

### 2.7 Financial instruments

## A. Financial assets

The classification of financial assets depends upon the group's business model and characteristics of the financial instrument's contractual cash flows, unless an option to measure the financial instrument at fair value through profit or loss has been exercised.

CGD classifies and measures a financial asset at amortised cost when it is included in a portfolio managed on the basis of a business model whose objective is achieved through the receipt of all contractual cash flows and when such cash flows may be considered payments of principal and interest on the outstanding principal. The group also classifies and measures a financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) when it is included in a portfolio managed on the basis of a business model whose objective is achieved either through the receipt of contractual cash flows comprising payments of principal and interest on outstanding principal or by sale. A financial asset is classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) when it is neither classified nor measured at amortised cost or by FVTOCI. At the time of initial recognition, however, the group may irrevocably opt to classify and measure an investment in an equity instrument through FVTOCI (when not held-for-trading nor comprising the recognition of a contingent payment by the acquirer in a business combination subject to IFRS 3 - "Business combinations") which otherwise would have been classified and measured by FVTPL.

To determine the business model used for the management of a financial asset, the group defines how it expects to obtain cash flows from the referred to financial asset. The business model is determined at a level that reflects how a group of financial assets is managed as a whole, in order to achieve the referred to business model's specific objective and is not reliant upon the plans for any financial asset in particular. As the allocation to a business model is a fact and not an assertion, the group considers all relevant information enabling a conclusion to be reached on the business model for the management of its financial assets. The group therefore evaluates:

- The way in which the performance of the business model and the financial assets held thereunder are measured and reported to management;
- The risks affecting the performance of the business model (and respective financial assets held thereunder) and, particularly, how such risks are managed; and
- The way in which managers are compensated (e.g. if based on the fair value of the assets managed or receipt of contractual cash flows).

As referred to above, two criteria are considered for the purpose of classifying and measuring financial assets under IFRS 9 - "Financial instruments":

- An entity's business model for managing the financial asset; and
- The characteristics of the financial asset's contractual cash flows: solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI).

Information on the classification process implemented by the group is set out in the following flowchart:
![img-36.jpeg](img-36.jpeg)

# Initial recognition 

A financial asset is recognised on the date upon which it is made available, i.e. the date upon which the funds are made available to the counterparty in the case of loans to customers or loans and advances to credit institutions or the settlement date in the case of equity instruments or debt securities.

Any change in the fair value of a financial asset between the trade and settlement dates is recognised according to the measurement criteria inherent to its classification at the time of initial registration.

## Derecognition

A financial asset is derecognised when, and only when, the contractual right to receive cash flows expires or the financial asset is transferred and the transfer is eligible for derecognition. A financial asset is considered to have been transferred if, and only if, the contractual rights to receive the cash flows from the said financial asset have been transferred or if the contractual rights to receive the cash flows on such assets have been retained but the group has contractually committed to deliver such cash flows to one or more beneficiaries. When the contractual rights to receive the cash flows are retained, the group only treats the operation as a transfer if all of the following conditions have been met:
(i) When the group is not obligated to pay any amounts to the beneficiary other than the amounts received from the original asset;
(ii) When the group is prevented from selling the original asset under the terms of the transfer agreement; and
(iii) When the group is obligated to pay the cash flows received, without any material delays and the cash flows cannot be reinvested up until such payment has been made.

When a financial asset's contractual cash flows are renegotiated or in any other way modified and such a renegotiation or modification does not result in the financial assets derecognition, the group recalculates the

financial asset's gross balance sheet amount and recognises profit or loss on the difference between the previous gross balance sheet amount. The asset's new gross balance sheet amount is determined as the present value of renegotiated or modified cash flows, discounted at the asset's original effective rate (or adjusted interest rate in the case of purchased or originated credit impaired loans) or, when applicable, the revised effective interest rate. Any costs or commissions incurred are included in the new gross balance sheet amount and amortised over the asset's remaining life.

A scenario in which the modification of the contractual cash flows results in the financial asset's derecognition implies the following:

- The need for a new analysis to determine whether the contractual conditions meet SPPI criteria;
- Initial recognition of the new financial asset at its fair value, with any difference between the former asset's net book value being recognised in profit and loss;
- If the contractual modifications derive from the restructuring of an asset owing to a debtor's financial difficulties, the new asset is defined as being POCI (purchased or originated credit impaired) with impairment losses being recognised on the basis of a lifetime PD, i.e. the new asset can never be classified in stage 1;
- The new asset's amortised cost will be measured on the basis of cash flow projections;
- The new financial asset recognised as the result of a contractual modification of a financial asset previously marked for forbearance (in accordance with Commission implementing regulation (EU) no. 2015/227 of January 9, 2015 and the internal policy defined by the group), will continue to be marked as such, with the cure period restarting from the date of the last restructuring operation; and
- For a financial asset originally classified in stage 3 for impairment model purposes and whose contractual modification leads to its respective derecognition, the new financial asset to be recognised will continue to be classified in stage 3 and may, based on the triggers defined by CGD for default definition purposes, be latterly transferred to stage 2 .


# Reclassification of financial assets 

If the group changes its financial assets management business model (which is only expected to occur relatively infrequently and on an exceptional basis) all of the financial assets affected are reclassified in conformity with the requirements of IFRS 9 - "Financial instruments". The reclassification is implemented prospectively from the date upon which it becomes effective. Under IFRS 9 - "Financial instruments", reclassifications of equity instruments on whose fair value assessment through other comprehensive income or financial assets and liabilities at fair value under the fair value option have been included, are not permitted.

## Fair value

As stated, "Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss" and "Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income" are measured at their fair value.

The fair value of a financial instrument comprises the amount at which an asset or financial liability can be sold or liquidated between independent, informed parties, interested in realising the transaction under normal market conditions.

The fair value of financial assets is measured by a CGD body which is independent from the trading function, based on the following criteria:

- Closing price at the balance sheet date, for instruments traded in active markets;
- Measurement methods and techniques are used for debt instruments not traded in active markets (including unlisted securities or securities with low liquidity levels) and include:
(i) Bid prices published by financial information services such as Bloomberg and Reuters, including market prices available on recent transactions;
(ii) Bid prices obtained from financial institutions operating as market-makers; and

(iii) Internal measurement models, based on market data which would be used to define the price of a financial instrument, reflecting market interest rates and volatility, in addition to the instrument's associated liquidity and credit risk.

- Investment funds not traded in active markets are measured on the basis of the last available NAV (net asset value). Whenever considered adequate, NAV may be adjusted on the basis of the group's critical appraisal of the measurement criteria on the assets under the management of the referred to investment funds.


# Amortised cost 

Financial instruments at amortised cost are initially recognised at fair value, net of the income or costs directly attributable to the transaction. Interest is recognised in accordance with the effective interest rate method.

Interest on impaired financial assets (stage 3) is recognised on the basis of the rate used to discount the future cash flows inherent to the measurement of the impairment loss.

## B. Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are recognised on the agreement date, at their respective fair value, net of the costs directly attributable to the transaction. Financial liabilities are classified in the following categories:

## - Financial liabilities held-for-trading

Financial liabilities held-for-trading include derivatives with a negative revaluation value, in addition to the short selling of fixed and variable-income securities in active markets.

These liabilities are recognised at their respective fair value. Profit or loss on their subsequent valuation is recognised in "Income from financial operations".

- Other financial liabilities

This category includes credit institutions' and customers' resources, bond issuances, subordinated liabilities and liabilities incurred on payments for the provision of services or purchase of assets, recognised in "Other liabilities".

These financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost. Any interest thereon is recognised by the effective interest rate method.

## C. Derivatives and hedge accounting

The group's activity includes operations on derivatives to meet the needs of its customers and reduce its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and price fluctuations.

Derivatives are recognised at their fair value at the agreement date. They are also recognised in off-balance sheet accounts at their respective notional value.

The fair value of derivatives not traded in organised markets is calculated by using models which incorporate measurement techniques based on discounted cash flows which also reflect counterparties' credit and own credit risk (credit value adjustments and debit value adjustments - CVAs/DVAs).

## Embedded derivatives

Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments recognised in liabilities are separated out from the host contract and processed separately, whenever:

- The embedded derivative's economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract; and
- The total combined financial instrument is not recognised at fair value, with respective changes being recognised in profit and loss.

The main impact of this procedure on the group's activity consists of the need to separate out and measure the value of derivatives embedded in deposits and debt instruments, i.e. instruments whose returns do not comprise interest (such as returns indexed to share prices or indices, exchange or other rates). At the time of separation, the derivative is recognised at its respective fair value, with the initial amount of the host contract comprising the difference between the total value of the combined contract and the derivative's initial revaluation. No profit is therefore recognised on the operation's initial recognition.

Trading derivatives include all derivatives not associated with effective hedge relationships, namely:

- Risk hedging derivatives on assets or liabilities recognised at fair value through profit or loss, thus rendering the use of hedge accounting unnecessary;
- Risk hedging derivatives which do not fulfil the conditions required for the use of hedge accounting under IFRS 9 - "Financial instruments", owing to the difficulty in specifically identifying the hedged items, in cases other than micro-hedges or when the results of the effectiveness tests show that they are not effective; and
- Derivatives contracted for trading purposes.

Trading derivatives are registered at fair value and the results of their revaluation are registered on a daily basis and recognised in "Income from financial operations" in income and costs for the period, except for the part relating to accrued and liquidated interest, which is recognised in "Interest and similar income" and "Interest and similar costs". Positive and negative revaluations are recognised in "Financial assets held-fortrading" and "Financial liabilities held-for-trading" balance sheet accounts, respectively.

# Hedge derivatives 

These derivatives are contracted for to hedge the group's exposure to the risks inherent to its activity.
At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 the group only hedged its exposure to changes in the fair value of financial instruments recognised in its balance sheet and referred to as "Fair value hedges".

The group prepares formal documentation when a hedge relationship is entered into, to include the following minimum aspects:

- Risk management objectives and strategy associated with the hedge operation, according to defined risk hedging policies;
- Description of hedged risk(s);
- Identification and description of hedged and hedging financial instruments; and
- Hedge effectiveness and periodicity assessment method.

Hedge derivatives are registered at fair value and their results recognised daily in income and costs for the period. If the hedge is shown to be effective, the group also recognises the change in fair value of the hedged item, attributable to the hedged risk, in "Income from financial operations" in profit and loss for the period. In the case of instruments such as interest rate swaps, which include an interest component, accrued interest for the current period and realised cash flows are recognised in "Interest and similar income" and "Interest and similar costs" in net interest income.

Hedge accounting is discontinued whenever hedges no longer meet the hedge accounting requirements defined in the standard. In such situations adjustments to hedged items up to the date upon which hedge accounting is no longer applied, are recognised in profit and loss up to the maturity of the corresponding financial asset or liability, based on the effective interest rate method.

Positive and negative revaluations of hedge derivatives are recognised in specific assets and liabilities accounts, respectively.

Measurements of hedged items are classified in the balance sheet accounts in which the instruments are recognised.

- Assessment of the effectiveness of hedge relationships based on interest rate swaps

The qualitative effectiveness of a hedge relationship is measured on the basis of a comparison between the critical terms of the hedged item and hedging instrument. The hedge relationship is expected to be highly effective as the key terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged item (such as notional amount, amortisation schedule, interest rate indexer, start and maturity dates) are exactly the same with the only source of ineffectiveness identified being the different basis for calculating interest between the hedged item and hedging instrument, which, as explained below, should not call into question the effectiveness of the hedge relationship.

This form of measuring a hedge's effectiveness is consistent with the management approach used to monitor the hedge - guaranteeing that the hedge is back-to-back and only ensuring, at any given time, that the notional amount of the contracted derivatives equals the nominal value of the bonds held.

Although considering that the critical terms comparison method is sufficient to reach a conclusion as to the effectiveness of the hedge relationship (in spite of the source of ineffectiveness identified) a quantitative analysis was carried out at the time of initial designation in order to reinforce the previous conclusion regarding the existence of an economic relationship.

In this context, a sensitivity analysis was carried out on the changes in fair value of the hedged item and hedging instrument vis-à-vis changes in interest rates. This was done using the DV01 metric, as one of CGD's risk metrics for interest rate risk management purposes.

- Measurement of the effectiveness of the hedge relationship based on interest rate futures on German sovereign bonds

The effectiveness of the hedge relationship is measured quantitatively, as the terms of the hedged item and the hedging instruments are not directly comparable. On the other hand, as futures are standardised products, they cannot be adjusted to the characteristics of the hedged item and a qualitative measurement based on a comparison of critical terms is not adequate.

An approach that presupposes the use of a quantitative method was accordingly considered for the purpose of measuring the prospective effectiveness of the hedge relationship. The method used consists of the analysis of sensitivity to changes in the fair value of the hedged item and the hedging instrument to changes in the market interest rate. This was done using the DV01 metric, as one of CGD's preferred risk metrics for interest rate risk management purposes.

- Sources of the ineffectiveness of hedge relationships based on interest rate swaps

As already stated and taking the characteristics of the hedged item and hedging instruments into account, the only source of ineffectiveness in this hedge relationship is the different basis used to calculate interest between the hedged item and the hedging instrument. We consider that cash flow spreads resulting from this situation are not expected to put the overall effectiveness of the hedge relationship at risk, with the amount of this ineffectiveness being recognised by revaluations of the hedged item and the hedging instruments in profit and loss.

- Sources of the ineffectiveness of hedge relathionships based on interest rate futures on German sovereign bonds

The above referred to hedge relationship contains sources of ineffectiveness that lead to a situation in which the hedge does not result in a nil fair value change:

- The quantity of the nominal amount between the hedges item and hedging instrument is not stictly equivalent;
- Change of cheapest-to-deliver bond;
- Aquisitions of the instrument designated as a hedged item when designated in the same hedge relationship ans disposals of the hedged item;
- Sale or aquisition of new hedging instruments; and
- Credit risk.

As futures are traded in contracts of $€ 100$ thousand, the amounts needed to hedge the full amount of changes in interest rates may, on occasions, be slightly unbalanced.

A change in the cheapest-to-deliver bond, may change the quantity of futures needed to cover the hedged item, as there may be a slight alteration in sensitivity to interest rates.

The disposal or acquisition of quantities of the hedged item may result in ineffectiveness at specific times of the hedge relationship, owing to daily changes in valuations of purchases or conversely of sales, until such time as the structure is rebalanced.

- Frequency of assessment of compliance with hedge ratio effectiveness requirements

CGD considers whether the hedge relationship meets hedge effectiveness requirements when a hedge relationship is entered into and on an ongoing basis. At the very least CGD carries out an ongoing assessment in each reporting period or whenever there is a significant change in the circumstances affecting hedge effectiveness requirements, whichever occurs soonest.

- Rebalancing of the hedge relationship

When a hedge relationship no longer meets the hedge effectiveness requirement for the hedge relationship but the risk management objective for this relationship has not been changed, CGD shall adjust the respective ratio. This rebalancing refers to adjustments made to the designated quantities of the hedged item or hedging instrument in this relationship in order to maintain a hedge ratio in accordance with the defined risk management objective.

In such a context and in a scenario in which:
(i) New securities are acquired and when a new hedge relationship for these securities acquisitions has not been designated, but when the designation of these new securities in this hedge relationship is used; or,
(ii) In the event of the partial disposal of the securities designated as hedged items in this hedge relationship and when CGD rebalances the hedge relationship in such a way as for the hedge relationship to remain in conformity with the defined risk management objective.

All elements of a hedge relationship shall be discontinued when, taken as a whole, it no longer meets the qualification criteria, namely when:
(i) A hedge ratio no longer meets the risk management objective on whose basis it was qualified for hedge accounting purposes;
(ii) The hedging instrument is sold or cancelled; and
(iii) An economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument no longer exists or the credit risk effect begins to dominate changes in value resulting from the referred to economic relationship.

# D. Impaired financial assets 

The impairment model of IFRS 9 - "Financial instruments" applies to the following financial assets:

- All financial assets measured at amortised cost (including lease agreements - IFRS 16 - "Leases");
- Debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI);
- The rights and obligations referred to in IFRS 15 - "Revenue from contracts with customers", when this standard refers to accounting under IFRS 9 -"Financial instruments";
- Assets which translate the right to the reimbursement of payments made by an entity when liquidating the liabilities recognised under IAS 37 - "Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets"; and
- Loan liabilities (unless measured at fair value through profit or loss).

These financial assets are divided up into 3 risk groups:
Stage 1 - assets without a significant deterioration in credit risk since the time of their initial recognition;
Stage 2 - assets with a significant deterioration in credit risk since the time of their initial recognition; and

Stage 3 - impaired assets (assets in default).
Depending upon the classification of the operation's stage, credit losses are estimated on the basis of the following criteria:

- 12 month expected losses. This is the expected loss deriving from a loss event occurring in the 12 months following the calculation date, applied in stage 1 operations; and

- Lifetime expected losses. This is the expected loss based on the difference between contractual cash flows and cash flows the entity expects to receive up to the contract's maturity. The expected loss is therefore the result of all potential loss events up to maturity and is applied in stage 2 and 3 operations.

Although IFRS 9 - "Financial instruments" does not define a concept of default, CGD group applies the same definition of default as used for management purposes, on an internal credit risk level, which incorporates the EBA's recommendations as set out in its "Final Report on Guidelines on Default Definition (EBA-GL-2016-07)" published on September 28, 2016.

Stage 2 classification is based on the observation of a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since the time of initial recognition.

The quantitative metric used to decide when an asset is transferred to stage 2 is based on a comparison of the deterioration of the forward-looking probability of lifetime default between the date of initial recognition and the reporting date.

Qualitative criteria for the transfer of a financial asset to stage 2 were also considered: credit in arrears for more than 30 days (backstop), restructured credit based on financial difficulties and objective credit risk criteria noted when monitoring customers.

Although based on historical and current information, the measurement of an expected loss also incorporates reliable, reasonable, justifiable and forward-looking projection scenarios which are available at no cost or without unduly excessive endeavours.

The amount of the expected credit loss to be recognised accordingly considers a forward-looking component based on the weighting of three different macroeconomic scenarios (central, pessimistic and optimistic). The scenarios to be considered are defined by a methodological approach comprising the projection of macroeconomic variables in which the probabilities of the occurrence of each of the scenarios are defined internally.

Evidence of impairment is measured on individually significant exposures and individually or collectively for exposures which are not individually significant. If no objective evidence of impairment for a certain exposure is considered, whether or not significant, it is measured collectively.

# 2.8 Non-current assets held-for-sale and assets and liabilities disposal groups 

IFRS 5 - "Non-current assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations" applies to individual assets and assets disposal groups, either by sale or another aggregate means, in a single transaction and all liabilities directly associated with such assets, which may be transferred in the transaction (referred to as "assets and liabilities disposal groups").

Non-current assets or assets and liabilities disposal groups are classified as being held-for-sale whenever their book value is expected to be recovered on sale and not continued use. The following requirements must be met for an asset (or assets and liabilities disposal group) to be classified in this account:

- There must be a strong probability of sale;
- The asset must be available for immediate sale in its present state; and
- The sale is expected to take place within a year from the asset's classification in this account.

Assets recognised in this account are not depreciated and their value is measured at their acquisition cost or fair value, whichever the lesser amount, net of the costs incurred on the sale. The assets' fair value is measured by appraisers.

Impairment losses are recognised in "Impairment of other assets, net of reversals and recoveries" if the assets' book value exceeds their fair value, net of sales costs.

Property and other assets which have been auctioned for overdue credit recovery purposes are also recognised in this account at the lesser of the following amounts:
(i) O Bid price; or
(ii) Balance sheet carrying amount, net of impairment on the recovered loans with which they are directly associated.

The group periodically analyses the recoverable value of property repossessed for credit recovery purposes or other property reclassified as non-current assets held-for-sale based on a specially developed impairment model.

Impairment model
The impairment model for non-current property held-for-sale is split up between individually and collectively analysed property.

Impairment on property assets is measured separately for all property with a gross book value (before impairment) of $€ 3,000$ thousand or more and properties with a lesser book value, when an individual analysis is justified by their specific characteristics.

Individual impairment is measured on the basis of an individual analysis of each property's worth in accordance with the commercial disinvestment strategy for the property which includes all information available on demand, supply and specific risks such as licences, investment needs, occupancy status and rental or other agreements which could affect the property's value.

Impairment on other property is measured on the basis of a collective model, namely:

- The collective model for calculating impairment on property assets is based on an assessment of the recoverable value of each property and comprises its acquisition price to which an adjustment factor is applied and discounted over an average length of time estimated for the sale. Both parameters are measured on the basis of the type of property and the length of time it has been listed in the portfolio. Impairment is calculated on the difference between the acquisition price and recoverable amount.
- This collective impairment model applies to all property not included in an individual analysis, except for properties with promissory contracts or when an immediate sales process is in progress, whose recoverable amount is the amount negotiated for its sale. Promissory sales contracts and properties with an immediate sales process in progress, not in excess of 30 days, are considered valid for this purpose. If the referred to period is exceeded, impairment is calculated on the basis of the collective parameters model.

A reversal of impairment losses for past periods is always recognised when the property is sold or when there is evidence to the effect that the previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have diminished. An impairment loss on an asset which has been recognised in past periods is reversed in the event of any alteration to the estimates used to measure the asset's recoverable amount since the time of recognition of the last impairment loss.

Auctioned assets are written-off and the amount of the respective proceeds is measured by the difference, on the said date, between its realisation price and respective book value, adjusted for impairment.

# 2.9 Investment properties 

Investment properties are properties held by the group with the objective of receiving income from their rental and/or appreciation in value.

Investment properties are not depreciated and are recognised at fair value, determined annually on the basis of experts' appraisals. Fair value changes are recognised in "Other operating income" in profit and loss.

### 2.10 Other tangible assets

Other tangible assets are recognised at their acquisition cost, revalued under the applicable legal provisions and net of their accrued depreciation and impairment losses. The costs of repairs, maintenance and other costs associated with their use, not incorporated in the asset, are recognised as a cost for the period in "General administrative costs".

The group revalued its tangible assets up to January 1, 2004 under the terms of the applicable legislation. As permitted by IFRS 1 - "First time adoption of international financial reporting standards", their cost, in the transition to IFRS, including the effect of the referred to revaluations, was deemed to be their book value, as the respective proceeds, at the time of the referred to revaluations generally corresponded to cost or depreciated cost under international accounting standards, adjusted to reflect alterations in price indices. As, in Portugal, $40 \%$ of the increase in depreciation on these revaluations is not tax deductible, the corresponding deferred tax liabilities thereon have been recognised.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis across an asset's estimated useful life, comprising the period in which it is expected to be available for use, as follows:

|  | Useful life (years) |
| :-- | :--: |
| Property for own use | $50-100$ |
| Equipment |  |
| Furniture and material | 8 |
| Machines and tools | $5-8$ |
| Computer equipment | $3-8$ |
| Interior fittings | $3-10$ |
| Transport material | $4-6$ |
| Security equipment | $4-10$ |

Land is not depreciated.
The cost of works on and improvements to property used by the group under operating leases is capitalised in this account and depreciated over an average period of 10 years.

Depreciation is recognised as a cost for the period.
Tests to identify signs of impairment on tangible assets are performed annually. An impairment loss is recognised in "Impairment of other assets net of reversals and recoveries" in profit and loss whenever the net book value of tangible assets is higher than their recoverable value (value-in-use or fair value whichever the higher). Impairment losses may be reversed and also have an impact on profit and loss in the event of a subsequent increase in an asset's recoverable value.

The group assesses the adequacy of its tangible assets' estimated useful lives on an annual basis.

# 2.11 Leases 

IFRS 16 - "Leases" - defines the principles applicable to the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of lease agreements, with the objective of ensuring pertinent information to provide an accurate description of such transactions.

## Lessee

The standard defines a unique accounting procedure for lease agreements, based on the recognition of a right-to-use asset and a lease liability for all lease agreements other than agreements with a maturity of less than 12 months or leases on low value assets in which the lessee may opt for exemption from the recognition provided for in IFRS 16, in which case it recognises the lease payments for these agreements as costs. CGD considers an underlying asset to be of low value when the value of the new asset is less than $€ 4,688$ (according to IASB guidelines - as translated from dollars to euros at the December 2022 closing rate).

## Lessor

Leases are classified as financial or operating leases. Assets under financial leases are recognised in the balance sheet as "Loans and advances to customers" and reimbursed by the repayment of principal as set out in the agreements' financial schedules. Interest included in the instalments is recognised as "Interest and similar income".

### 2.12 Intangible assets

This account essentially comprises the costs of acquiring, developing or preparing software for use on the group's activities. When the requirements of IAS 38 - "Intangible assets" are met, the direct internal costs incurred on software development are capitalised as intangible assets. These costs essentially comprise employee costs.

Intangible assets are recognised at their acquisition cost, net of accrued depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is recognised on a straight line basis across the assets' estimated useful lives, which is between 3 and 6 years.

Software maintenance costs are recognised as a cost for the period in which they have been incurred.

# 2.13 Income taxes 

## Current tax

CGD pays tax under the fiscal regime set out in the IRC (corporate income tax) code and is taxed under the special tax regime for corporate groupings of article 69 et seq of the referred to code. The group perimeter covered by the referred to tax regime, in which CGD is the dominant entity, comprises all companies with headquarters or effective management in Portugal, whose total income is subject to the general IRC tax regime, at the highest standard rate, in whose equity capital it has held either a direct or indirect stake of at least $75 \%$, for a period of more than 1 year and when such an equity stake entitles it to more than $50 \%$ of voting rights. The group's taxable profit is calculated on the algebraic sum of the separate taxable profit and losses made by each of the companies in the perimeter.

Branch accounts are included in the respective headquarters' accounts under the principle of the taxation of global profit of article 4 of the IRC code. In addition to being subject to IRC, in Portugal, the profit made by branches may also be subject to local taxes in the countries/territories in which they are established. Local taxes are deductible from the group's IRC tax bill as a tax credit in accordance with double taxation agreements under article 91 of the respective code.

Current tax is calculated on taxable profit for the period which differs from accounting income owing to adjustments resulting from costs or income which are not relevant for fiscal purposes or only considered in other accounting periods. They particularly include:

- Profits made by non-resident subsidiaries with a more favourable tax regime

Under article 66 of the IRC code, the profits made by non-resident companies benefiting from a clearly more favourable tax regime is included in CGD's accounts, in proportion to its equity stake and independently of its distribution, provided that CGD has a direct or indirect equity stake of at least $25 \%$, voting rights or rights to income or a part of such entities' equity.

An entity is considered to benefit from a clearly more favourable regime when:
(i) it is resident in a territory listed in a ministerial order approved by the member of government responsible for the finance area or;
(ii) the income tax effectively paid is less than $50 \%$ of the IRC rate payable under the IRC code.

The profit, in such cases, is included in the period in which the end of the non-resident company's tax period is included in the form of the proportion of its net profit to CGD's capital holding. The amount of income included is deductible from the taxable profit for the period in which the referred to profit is distributed to CGD. CGD does not recognise any deferred taxes for this situation.

- Impaired credit

Law 98/2019 was published on September 4, 2019. It alters the IRC code on impairment in credit institutions and other financial institutions and creates rules on as yet non-tax deductible impairment losses not recognised in taxation periods prior to January 1, 2019. Under this new regime, impairment losses on the credit risk of individually analysed exposures or when analysed on a collective basis and in taxation periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, recognised under the terms of the applicable accounting and regulatory standards (with the exceptions provided for in no. 7 of article 28 -C of the IRC code) are now fully deductible. The rules in force up to December 31, 2018, i.e. limitation of tax deductions to the amounts calculated under the provisions of Bank of Portugal notice 3/95 (latterly revoked) and provided that the credit was not covered by real rights over immovable assets, continue to apply to impairment losses and other value adjustments for specific credit risk, accounted for in past tax periods.

Based on the provisions of article 4 of the new law, CGD formalised its intention to subscribe for the new regime for the tax periods beginning January 1, 2019 in the form of a communication addressed to the director general of the tax and customs authority on October 31, 2019 from which tax year it is covered by the new regime.

- Credit write-offs

At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 the group continued to recognise deferred tax assets on non tax deductible impairment on credit operations which had already been written off from assets, based

on the expectation of their inclusion as taxable material in the taxation periods in which the conditions required for their deduction have been fulfilled, both on a level of the delay period ( 24 months) and compliance with the limits set out in the legislation in force on the referred to dates or, additionally, in the event of the occurrence of any of the conditions of article 41 of the corporate tax code (bad debts).

- Impaired financial investments

Under the provisions of no. 2 of article 28-A of the corporate tax code, impairment losses on securities and other investments, recognised in accordance with the accounting standards applicable to entities supervised by the Bank of Portugal are considered to be tax deductible.

Article 51-C of the corporate tax code was amended by the publication of law 42/2016, based on an addendum to no. 6, ruling that, for 2017 and following periods, impairment losses and other value adjustments on equity investments or other own equity instruments, included in taxable profit, are considered to be positive components of taxable profit for the taxation period in which the respective sale has taken place. As a result of this situation, CGD began to recognise deferred tax liabilities on impaired financial investments as being deductible as a tax cost at the time of the constitution thereof when the intention involves a sale or liquidation (or when in progress). These amounted to $€ 42,776$ thousand and $€ 30,055$ thousand, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

The amount of unrecognised deferred tax liabilities on the impaired tax deductible financial investments, owing to the unlikelihood of any changes to the board of directors' strategy regarding the management of such investments, i.e. no prospects of sale or liquidation in the foreseeable future, amounted to $€ 65,915$ thousand and $€ 71,173$ thousand at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 respectively.

- Employee costs

CGD has considered its payment of employee costs, as processed and recognised in its accounts, including, inter alia, costs associated with pensions liabilities and other post employment benefits, to be tax deductible, up to the limit of the contributions effectively paid into the pension fund. This procedure is in line with the respective understanding on this matter of January 19, 2006 of the secretary of state for fiscal affairs, according to which, the amounts recognised in costs under the terms of the applicable accounting regulations, limited to the amount of the contribution effectively paid into the pension fund in the same or past periods are tax deductible under article 43 of the IRC code.

Also herein and as a result of the alteration of the accounting policy on the recognition of actuarial profit and loss on pension plans and other post employment benefits, with reference to December 31, 2011, the full amount of the deferred net liabilities balance in CGD's balance sheet at the said date was recognised as a charge to reserves. As the component of $€ 60,837$ thousand relating to pension liabilities fulfilled the requirements of article 183 of law 64-B/2011 of December 30, the negative equity changes originated in 2011, which were not considered for tax purposes, in the period, were recognised as a deduction from taxable profit, in equal parts, in the ten years beginning on or after January 1, 2012.

CGD did not recognise deferred tax on actuarial or financial profit and loss on its pension plan for its working employees at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

- Settlement result

Under article 92 of the IRC code, taxable income, net of international double taxation deductions and fiscal benefits, may not be less than $90 \%$ of the amount that would have been determined if the taxpayer:
(i) Did not enjoy fiscal benefits and
(ii) Did not make supplementary contributions to pension funds and the like to cover retirement pension liabilities as a result of the implementation of the international accounting standards.

The referred to limitation does not apply to the fiscal benefits listed in no. 2 of the same article.
CGD did not make any adjustments to the assessment of its taxable income for the 2022 and 2021 financial years as a result of the application of this article.

# Deferred taxes 

Total income tax recognised in profit and loss includes current and deferred tax.

Deferred tax comprises the impact on the tax to be paid or recovered in future periods of temporary deductible or taxable differences between the book value of assets and liabilities and their fiscal basis used to determine taxable income.

Whereas deferred tax liabilities are normally recognised for all temporary taxable differences, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the amount of the probable existence of sufficient future taxable profit to enable the corresponding deductible tax differences or carry-back of tax losses to be used. Neither are deferred tax assets recognised in cases in which their recoverability is questionable on account of other situations, including different interpretations of the tax legislation in force.

Nor is deferred tax on temporary differences originating on the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in transactions which do not affect accounting income or taxable profit recognised.

The principal situations originating temporary differences on a group level are temporarily non-tax deductible provisions, impairment and employee benefits.

Deferred taxes are calculated on the basis of the tax rates expected to be in force upon the temporary differences' reversal dates, comprising the approved or substantially approved rates, at the balance sheet date.

Income tax (current or deferred) is recognised in profit and loss for the period, unless their originating transactions have been recognised in other equity accounts. The corresponding tax, in these situations, is also recognised as a charge to equity.

# 2.14 Provisions and contingent liabilities 

A provision is set up whenever a current (legal or constructive) obligation resulting from past events involves the probable future expenditure of resources and when this may be reliably assessed. The amount of the provision comprises the best estimate of the amount to be paid to liquidate the liability at the date of the balance sheet.

When not probable, the future expenditure of resources is considered to be a contingent liability. Contingent liabilities require no more than a disclosure procedure, unless the possibility of their occurrence is remote.

Provisions for other risks are for:

- Liabilities for guarantees provided and other off-balance sheet liabilities, based on a risk analysis of operations and respective customers; and
- Legal, fiscal and other contingencies resulting from the group's activity.


### 2.15 Employee benefits

Liabilities for employee benefits are recognised in accordance with the principles of IAS 19 - "Employee benefits". The group's principal benefits include retirement and survivors' pensions, healthcare costs and other long term benefits.

## Pensions and healthcare liabilities

CGD group has several pension plans, including defined benefit and, in several situations, defined contribution plans. CGD has set up a defined benefit pension plan which aims to ensure the payment of employees' retirement, disability and survivors' pensions. Other group companies, including Banco Comercial do Atlântico and Banco Nacional Ultramarino (Macau) also have liabilities for defined benefit plans.

Healthcare for CGD Portugal's working and retired employees is also provided by Caixa Geral de Depósitos' social services and funded by contributions from CGD Portugal and its employees.

CGD also has liabilities for contributions to SAMS (healthcare services) for its former BNU employees retiring prior to the July 23, 2001 merger between BNU and CGD.

The liability for defined benefit plans recognised in the balance sheet comprises the difference between the present value of liabilities and fair value of the pension fund's assets. Total liabilities are calculated by specialised actuaries, using the unit credit projected method and adequate actuarial assumptions. The rate used for liabilities discounting purposes is based on market interest rates on investment grade corporate bonds denominated in the currencies in which the liabilities are paid and with similar periods to maturity to the average settlement period of the liabilities.

Profit and loss on differences between actuarial and financial assumptions and the effective amounts regarding the evolution of liabilities and the pension fund's expected yield, in addition to changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised as a charge to "Other reserves".

As the group does not usually assume any liability for defined contribution plans, other than its annual contributions, no additional costs are recognised.

Retirement pensions and healthcare costs for the period, including current servicing and net interest costs are aggregated and recognised in the appropriate "Employee costs" account.

The impact of employees' early retirements, as defined in the actuarial study, is also directly recognised in "Employee costs". CGD also recognises a specific liability for the impact of the changeover to "non-working" status of those employees with whom it has entered into voluntary redundancy agreements. This provision is recognised as a charge to "Employee costs" in profit and loss.

As shown in detail in notes 35 and 36 of the notes to the financial statements, on February 24, 2023, the Portuguese government published decree law 14/2023 transferring all of the liabilities of CGD's pension fund (FPCGD) to Caixa Geral de Aposentações (CGA), extinguishing and liquidating FPCGD and with payment of financial compensation for the liabilities transferred to CGA by CGD.

Under the terms of IAS 19, CGD recognised the premium paid on the operation, comprising the difference between the amount of liabilities calculated on a going concern basis and the amount defined in the operation, on the basis of a settlement scenario, in employee costs in profit and loss for 2022.

Pursuant to this transaction CGD provides CGA with a compensation mechanism for any deviations between the wage and pension growth rates assumed in the operation and the effective rates. This compensation will be determined in 2028 using data up to December 2027 and subject to a maximum amount of €320,000 thousand.

According to accounting standards (IAS 37), Caixa recognises the contingent liability associated with this compensation mechanism in its financial statements. The valuation carried out in the context of the preparation of the December 2022 financial statements has led to the conclusion that the mechanism has a nil value at this time, both on account of Caixa's management capacity over the various remuneration components with an impact on wage and pensions growth for its employees as a whole, liabilities for which are being transferred to CGA and the degree of conservatism of the premises underlying the transfer. Liabilities for healthcare costs are recognised in "Provisions for the costs of employee benefits" (note 24).

# Other long term benefits 

CGD also has other liabilities for long term benefits to its workers, including liabilities for early retirements, career bonuses (seniority bonus up to 2019) and grants for deaths occurring prior to the standard retirement age. Death grants after the standard retirement age are the responsibility of the pension fund.

Liabilities for such benefits are also based on actuarial assessments. All actuarial profit and loss is recognised as a charge to profit and loss for the period under IAS 19 - "Employee benefits" for the type of benefits identified.

Liabilities for the costs of seniority bonuses and death grants are recognised in "Other liabilities" (note 26) and "Provisions for the costs of employee benefits" (note 24), respectively.

## Short term benefits

Short term benefits, including employees' productivity bonuses, are recognised on an accrual basis (note 35) in "Employee costs" for the respective period.

## Redundancy benefits

Redundancy benefits include the costs of redundancy agreements between the group and its employees. These costs are recognised in "Employee costs" in profit and loss (note 35).

As referred to in note 2.7, commissions on credit operations and other financial instruments, i.e. commissions directly charged or paid on originating operations, are recognised over the course of such operations, in "Interest and similar income" and "Interest and similar costs" (note 30).

Commissions for services provided are usually recognised as income across the period of the provision of the service or as a lump sum if resulting from single acts.

# 2.17 Issuance of own equity instruments 

The issuance of own equity instruments is recognised at the fair value of the compensation received, net of the issuance's direct costs.

Preference shares issued by the group are classified on the basis of the criteria defined in IAS 32 - "Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation". Accordingly, in situations in which payments of dividends and/or redemptions are exclusively at the group's discretion, the securities issued are considered to be own equity instruments. Preference shares issued by subsidiaries fulfilling these requirements are recognised in "Noncontrolling interests" in the consolidated balance sheet (note 29).

### 2.18 Securities and other items held under custody

Securities and other items held under custody, i.e. customers' securities, are recognised in off-balance sheet accounts, preferably at their fair or nominal value.

### 2.19 Cash and cash equivalents

For the preparation of its cash flow statement, the group considers "Cash and cash equivalents" to be the "Cash and cash equivalents at central banks" (note 4) and "Cash balances at other credit institutions" (note 5) total.
2.20 Critical accounting estimates and more relevant judgmental aspects for the implementation of accounting policies

The implementation of the above referred to accounting policies requires CGD's executive committee and group entities to make estimates. The estimates having the greatest impact on the consolidated financial statements, include those set out below. The effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and crisis in eastern Europe deriving from the ongoing war between the Russian Federation and Ukraine were also taken into consideration, whenever relevant.
a) Measurement of impairment losses on loans and advances to customers

Impairment losses on loans at amortised cost are measured by the methodology defined in note 2.7. d). This measurement is, inter alia, based on a series of weighting factors reflecting knowledge of a customer's circumstances, treatment of historical data and amount of guarantees associated with the operations in question and is therefore highly subjective.

The group considers that impairment measured by this methodology enables the risks on its credit portfolio to be adequately recognised, in conformity with the rules defined in IFRS 9 - "Financial instruments".
b) Measurement of impairment losses on debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income

According to the measurement requirements on such assets, fair value changes are recognised as a charge to other comprehensive income. Whenever the results of the analyses (note 2.7. d)), indicate the existence of impairment, the amount of the estimated loss is reclassified from other comprehensive income to costs for the period.

This measurement is based on available market information and includes modelling assumptions and judgements, alterations to which could produce different results. The group, however, considers that impairment measured by the use of this methodology adequately reflects the risk associated with such assets, taking the rules defined in IFRS 9 - "Financial instruments" into account.
c) Measurement of financial instruments not traded in active markets

Under IFRS 9 - "Financial Instruments", the group measures all financial instruments at fair value, except for those recognised at amortised cost. The measurement models and techniques described in note 2.7. are used to measure the value of financial instruments not traded in liquid markets. The measurements obtained comprise the best estimate of the fair value of the referred to instruments, at the date of the balance sheet.

To ensure adequate separation between functions, the value of such financial instruments is measured by a body that is independent from the trading function.

# d) Measurement of non-current assets held-for-sale - investments in subsidiaries 

The measurement of investments in subsidiaries recognised in "Non-current assets held-for-sale" accounts is based on measurement methodologies mainly supported by external valuations, which use different fair value measurement techniques, considering the management body's estimates for each entity, market conditions in which they operate and certain assumptions or judgments. Alternative methodologies and use of different assumptions and estimates may result in a different valuation level for these investments.

## e) Employee benefits

As referred to in note 2.15. the group's liabilities for the post employment and other long term benefits granted to its employees are determined actuarially. These actuarial assessments incorporate, inter alia, financial and actuarial assumptions on mortality, disability, wages and pension growth, returns on assets used to hedge these liabilities and discount rates. The assumptions reflect the group's and its actuaries' best estimates of the future performance of the respective variables.

## f) Determination of income tax

Income tax (current and deferred) is assessed by group companies on the basis of the rules defined in the current tax legislation of the countries in which they operate. In several situations, however, tax legislation is not sufficiently clear and objective and may give rise to different interpretations. The amounts recognised in such cases represent the best understanding of CGD group's entities on the correctness of the operations although this may be queried by the fiscal authorities.

The group's recognition of deferred tax assets, including the carry-back of tax losses, is based on its expectation of future taxable profit enabling them to be realised, determined on the basis of more up-to-date projections of accounting income and considering the objective defined for the reduction of non-performing assets. The recoverability of deferred tax assets is, therefore, contingent upon the successful implementation of CGD's board of directors' strategy, namely the capacity to generate the estimated taxable profit and interpretation of fiscal legislation in force in the future (note 19).

## g) Property valuations

Property valuations, recognised in "Non-current assets held-for-sale" consider a set of judgmental assumptions which are contingent upon each asset's specific characteristics and the group's respective marketing strategy. The assumptions regarding future events may not materialise or, even if materialising, could have different real results. By way of example, there may be changes on a level of property market expectations, relevant macroeconomic variables or on a level of the intrinsic characteristics of the actual property and its physical surrounds.

## h) Provisions and contingent liabilities

As referred to in note 2.14, provisions are always recognised whenever a present (legal or constructive) obligation requires a probable future payment and when this may be reliably measured.

Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements with information thereon being disclosed if the possibility of the need to make payments is not classified as being remote.

Decisions regarding the recognition of provisions and their respective measurement take into account the board of directors' assessment of the risks and uncertainties associated with ongoing processes and expected confirmation of cash flow projections, based on the best information available on the date upon which the financial statements are filed.

## i) Impairment of investments in associates and joint ventures

The group undertakes an annual year-end evaluation of the recoverable value of its investments in associates and joint ventures. Recoverable value is measured on the basis of valuation methodologies using discounted cash flow techniques, considering the board of directors' strategy for each entity, market conditions and value over time and business risks whose fair value is estimated by specific assumptions or judgements.

Alternative methodologies and the use of different assumptions and estimates could result in a different level of valuation of investments in associates and joint ventures and its consequent impact on the group's profit and loss.

The list of associates, branches and special purpose entities in the group's perimeter is presented in note 44.

The main movements in the group's subsidiaries, in 2022 and 2021, were as follows:

## Caixa Serviços Partilhados (CSP)

On February 9, 2022, owing to the fact that the insurance group companies were no longer members of Caixa Geral de Depósitos group, their exclusion as members of Caixa Serviços Partilhados, A.C.E. ("EIG") was requested. This economic interest grouping became a fully owned Caixa Geral de Depósitos ("CGD") subsidiary from the said date.

## Banco Interatlântico

CGD acquired 11,687 shares comprising $11.69 \%$ of the equity of Banco Interatlântico on August 3, 2022, increasing its stake in the bank from $70 \%$ to $81.687 \%$.

## Nostrum Mortgages N. ${ }^{\circ} 2$

Following CGD's resolution of August 22, the Nostrum 2010 transaction was amortised in advance and the portfolio loans repurchased from TAGUS (securitisation company), leading to the structure's liquidation.

# Projeto Crow 

In 2021, CGD and other investors ("vendors") used the ECS Capital fund manager to launch an organised, open sales process on 100\% of the shares of the FLIT - PTREL SICAV ("FLIT") fund, 100\% of the investment units of the Fundo de Recuperação Turismo, FCR ("FRT") in addition to several hotel assets owned by the Fundo de Recuperação, FCR ("Project Crow"). The process was completed on December 29, 2022. Under this operation, CGD became the owner of the companies FlitPtrel IV, S.A. and FlitPtrel Porto Santo, S.A. (referred to as "carve-out" assets), which became part of the CGD Group.

|  | $21,811,574$ | $23,000,073$ |

The objective of CGD's demand deposits with the Bank of Portugal is to comply with the minimum reserve requirements of the European Central Banks System (ECBS).

The funds deposited at central banks by CGD and CGD group banks at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 complied with the minimum limits defined by the regulations in force in the countries in which they operate.

The "Purchase operations with resale agreements" account at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 refers to contracts for the acquisition of financial instruments with a resale agreement at a future date at a predefined price. The financial instruments acquired in these operations are not recognised in the balance sheet and their purchase price continues to be recognised as a loan to credit institutions, measured at its respective amortized cost. These operations were contracted for under global master repurchase agreements (GMRAs) whose mechanisms provide for a strengthening of the collateral associated with such transactions based on the evolution of their respective market value determined in accordance with the specifications defined between the counterparties and usually in the form of surety deposits.

Information on impairment movements on loans and advances to credit institutions, for the periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 is set out in note 38.

The "Other financial instruments" account, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 includes $€ 158,331$ thousand and $€ 391,992$ thousand, respectively, in subscriptions for investments in vehicles created under financial assets lending operations (loans and advances to customers).

Following their transfer (to the company itself or companies owned by the corporate vehicle in which CGD has a stake), the referred to assets were derecognised from the balance sheet, as the respective IFRS 9 "Financial instruments" requirements, i.e. the transfer of a substantial part of the risks and benefits associated with the credit operations and their respective control were considered to have been met. The corporate vehicles in which CGD has a non-controlling interest are autonomous in terms of their management. To ensure the neutrality of operations, at the time of their realization, impairment on the estimated losses on the transferred assets was set against the amount of the equity investment in the respective associated corporate vehicles. Following their initial recognition, such holdings reflect the revaluation of such companies' equity.

Information on CGD's exposure to such assets at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 is set out below:

|   | $31-12-2022$ | $31-12-2021$  |

|   | 158,331 | 391,992  |

As the valuation of the asset transfer funds considers the group's analysis of the recoverable amount of each fund's equity, the amount recognised may be less than the respective NAV (net asset value) as calculated and disclosed by the management companies. Detailed information on the internal measurement criteria applied to these funds are given in note 43 - "Disclosures relating to financial instruments" in the chapter on "Restructuring funds".

Agreement for the sale of investments in restructuring funds and other assets (Project Crow)
In 2021, CGD and other investors ("vendors") used the ECS Capital fund manager to launch an organized, open sales process, on the sale of $100 \%$ of the shares of the FLIT - PTREL SICAV ("FLIT") fund, 100\% of the investment units of the Fundo de Recuperação Turismo, FCR ("FRT") in addition to several hotel assets owned by the Fundo de Recuperação ("Project Crow").

After entering into the purchase and sales and other agreements with a company related to Davidson Kempner Capital Management LP ("buyer") on August 12, 2022 the vendors completed the Crow Project on December 29, 2022 through the implementation of the agreements, following verification of the contractual suspensive conditions therein stipulated.

As a result of the completion of Project Crow:
(i) the investment units in the FRT held by the vendors, together with the assets held directly and indirectly by them, were sold to the buyer.
(ii) the shares owned by the vendors in the FLIT, together with the assets held directly and indirectly by them were also sold to the buyer.

Prior to the sale:
(iii) several hotel assets owned indirectly by the Fundo Recuperação FCR were acquired indirectly by FLIT (carve-in).
(iv) several assets owned indirectly by FLIT and the Fundo de Recuperação Turismo, FCR were transferred to the vendors (carve-out).

Considering the balance sheet carrying amounts of CGD's equity stakes in restructuring funds at December 31, 2022, the Crow Project allowed this type of assets to be deleveraged by around 46\%. The impacts of

this operation gave rise to the recognition of a profit of $€ 24,975$ thousand, recognised in financial operations in the profit and loss aggregate (note 33) and a loss of $€ 10,902$ thousand recognised in the other operating income aggregate (note 34).

The book value of the securities and property investment funds managed by group entities, recognised in financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was as follows:

|  | 31-12-2022 |  | 31-12-2021 |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  | Securities investment funds | Real estate investment funds | Securities investment funds | Real estate investment funds |
| Book value | 5,372 | 97,761 | 25,291 | 112,697 |

The book value of the securities funds managed by group entities, recognised in financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, at December 31, 2022 was as follows:

| Securities investment funds | Number | Book value |
| :-- | --: | --: |
| Caixagest Infraestruturas | 593,602 | 4,875 |

# 8. Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income 

This account comprises the following:

|  | 31-12-2022 | 31-12-2021 |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Debt instruments |  |  |
| Public debt | 859,410 | 2,050,522 |

| Impairment (Note 38) |  |  |
| Debt instruments | (163) | (485) |
|  | 2,367,366 | 6,031,819 |

The reduction of debt instruments comes under the aegis of liquidity surplus management and mainly derives from the decrease of the short term securities component, in which a contributory factor was the maturing of instruments held.

Details on the group's exposure to "Other Instruments" at fair value through other comprehensive income securities subscribed for under asset transfer operations, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, are as follows:

|  | 31-12-2022 |  | 31-12-2021 |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  | Book value | Fair value reserve | Book value | Fair value reserve |
| Discovery Portugal Real Estate Fund | 62,404 | $(22,935)$ | 62,404 | $(22,935)$ |

CGD opted to classify and measure the above referred to equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income in conformity with the option provided by IFRS 9 - "Financial instruments" (note 2.7). Detailed information on the internal measurement criteria applied to these funds are given in note 43 "Disclosures relating to financial instruments" in the chapter on "Restructuring funds".

The fair value reserves, net of deferred taxes associated with assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, amounted to $€ 16,133$ thousand and $€ 143,034$ thousand at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively (note 28).

# 9. Financial assets with repurchase agreements 

The following is a breakdown of information on financial assets with repurchase agreements at December 31, 2021:

|  | 31-12-2022 | 31-12-2021 |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| At fair value through other comprehensive income |  |  |
| Debt instruments from public issuers |  |  |
| Debt securities of other foreign public issuers | - | 7,828 |
|  | - | 7,828 |

The group entered into sales operations on financial assets with purchase agreements at a future date and predefined price with financial institutions and customers at December 31, 2021.

Financial instruments ceded in sales operations with repurchase agreements are not derecognised from the balance sheet and their value continues to be measured in accordance with the accounting policies applicable to the underlying assets. The difference between their sales and repurchase prices is recognised as interest income and deferred across the period of the agreement.

The liabilities arising on the repurchase agreements are recognised in "Customers' resources and other loans - Other resources - Operations with repurchase agreements" (note 22).

# 10. Derivatives 

The group's activity includes operations on derivatives to meet the needs of its customers and reduce its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and price fluctuations.

The group controls the risk attached to its derivatives activities on the basis of its approval procedures on operations, definition of exposure limits per product and customer and daily oversight of their evolution and respective results.

The value of these operations, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, was measured in conformity with the criteria described in note 2.7.c). A breakdown of information on the operations' notional and book values at the said dates is given below:

# 11. Hedge accounting 

As referred to in note 2.7. c), the group performs derivative operations with the objective of hedging its exposure to the risks inherent to its activity. In 2022 and 2021 the hedge accounting option in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9 applied to the change in the fair value hedge model associated with interest rate risk on the securities portfolio in addition to non-subordinated debt issued under the EMTN programme.

Hedge derivatives are measured at their fair value and their respective changes are recognised as a charge to profit or loss. The fair value of derivatives not traded in organised markets is calculated on the basis of internal models that incorporate discounted cash flow measurement techniques which make use of observable market data, whenever available. According to the fair value ranking criteria set out in note 43, these instruments are classified at level 2.

Within the framework of CGD group's balance sheet interest rate risk management strategy, which is in conformity with the principles set out in the corporate balance sheet interest rate risk management policy and CGD's risk appetite statement and which aims to reduce the volatility of the bank's net interest income and capital to interest rate changes, in addition to the guidelines on securities in banking book securities portfolios at fair value through other comprehensive income, which set out, inter alia, limits on the interest rate risk that may be incurred by holding such securities, hedge operations are performed on several portfolios to ensure compliance with the limits set out in the guidelines.

These hedges aim to reduce exposure to interest rate risk on debt securities and translate into a limitation of the impact of changes in the benchmark rate on the value of debt securities in the banking portfolio at fair value through other comprehensive income, essentially sovereign debt securities, i.e. changes in the time structure of interest rates. This involves hedge operations based on interest rate swaps and/or interest rate futures on Republic of Germany bonds. Therefore, the effect of changes in the value of assets owing to changes in market interest rate is recognised in profit or loss, offsetting the effect of changes in the value of interest rate swaps and interest rate futures on German sovereign bonds that are also recognised in profit or loss. The credit risk attached to the issuers of debt securities is not considered part of the hedge relationship.

Taking the characteristics of debt securities into account and the intended designation of the hedge relationship, the hedged part of each debt security will be the benchmark component. As this component is separately identifiable in the yield curves observable at the date of the hedge's designation, the hedged item is represented by a bond whose contractual conditions are exactly the same as the bond held but at a fixed interest rate corresponding to the applicable benchmark risk-free interest rate on the period to maturity of the hedged item, taking the time structure of interest rates into account.

As referred to above, hedges are performed on the basis of interest rate swaps and interest rate futures operations whose DV01 is practically equivalent to that obtained from the hedged item designated in the hedge relationship. It should be added that as interest rate futures have a maturity of 3 months, these derivatives are rolled over and the quantity of the contracts are adjusted by the quantities necessary to satisfy the changes in the DV01 ratio, in such a way as for the hedging of fair value changes attributed to changes in market interest rate to be $100 \%$.

Lastly, in terms of hedge effectiveness requirements, it should be noted that the hedge ratio in the hedge relationship should be identical to that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the entity effectively hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity effectively uses to hedge the quantity of the hedged item. Therefore, considering the strategy adopted by CGD to fully hedge the interest rate risk on bonds, the hedge ratio to be considered is $100 \%$. However, at each revaluation date an assessment should be made in order to adjust the quantities of hedging instruments to provide for the changes in sensitivity to interest rate.

## Other credit disposal operations

CGD disposed of a series of mainly non-performing mortgage and non-mortgage loans with a book value, before impairment on the transaction date of approximately $€ 74,822$ thousand in 2022. The losses made on these loans were recognised in "Impaired credit net of reversals and recoveries" in profit and loss (note 38).

Credit-write offs on the asset at the time of the transaction were also included. Income of approximately $€ 15,765$ thousand (note 38) was also recognised on these operations.

The "Loans" portfolio at December 31, 2021 includes mortgage loans assigned by CGD as part of securitisation operations. Movements in this loan account, in 2021 and 2022, were as follows:

|  | Nostrum <br> Mortgages no. 2 |

The Nostrum 2010 transaction was amortised in advance following CGD's resolution of August 22, 2022 and the portfolio loans were repurchased from TAGUS (securitisation company). Following the amortisation, the transfer of the amount collected in each period (principal and interest) was suspended from the cut-off date of July 31, 2022, which led to CGD's repurchase of the portfolio loans. The amortisation date was set at the coupon date of August 22, 2022, on which date CGD repurchased the loans from Tagus (securitisation company) having, on the same date made an early redemption of the bonds (class A, B and C) as well as ending the swaps and closing the accounts associated with the transaction.

The "Loans" account, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 includes mortgage loans with a book value of $€ 4,085,921$ thousand and $€ 5,604,258$ thousand, respectively, allocated to the issuance of covered bonds.

# Subsidiaries 

In the framework of CGD's recapitalisation commitments, agreed between the Portuguese state, as the sole shareholder of Caixa Geral de Depósitos and the competent European authorities, CGD took a series of steps leading to the disposal of the group's equity stakes in Banco Caixa Geral - Brasil, S.A., CGD Investimentos CVC, S.A. and Banco Comercial do Atlântico in the Republic of Cape Verde. The investment balances in these entities, net of their respective impairment, were reclassified from "Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures" to "Non-current assets held-for-sale", as a direct result of this situation.

The BCG Brazil disposal process was, in the first instance, conditioned by the period of political instability affecting the country in 2018 which was responsible for various delays to the completion of several initially scheduled initiatives which it was only possible to develop further across 2019. The government's approval of the tender documents for the direct sale of BCG Brazil's equity shares held directly and indirectly by Caixa Geral de Depósitos in August 2019 was particularly relevant in these circumstances.

A capital reduction of $€ 71,689$ thousand and $€ 2,732$ thousand in BCG Brazil and CGD Investimentos, respectively (at the December 2019 exchange rate) was approved during the course of 2019 in preparation of the current disposal process.

On September 4, 2019 the Portuguese government selected three investors for stage II, beginning September 25 (following the publication of the ministerial order announcing the periods for stage II on September 24) whose bidders were able to prepare a comprehensive due diligence report on BCG Brazil and interact with CGD on strategic matters, in addition to key aspects underpinning the transaction documents.

None of the binding offers received on December 16, 2019, was considered acceptable by CGD and the process was brought to an unsuccessful conclusion.

Initiatives leading to consideration of the opportunity to initiate new contacts with potential investors were resumed during the course of 2020, despite the uncertainty deriving from the effects of the current pandemic. Notwithstanding the various initiatives initiated with a view to the disposal of the bank, it has not, as yet, been possible to successfully complete this process. A significant factor in this situation has been the context of major political-economic instability characterising not only Brazil but the world as a whole, in which reference should be made to the effects of the crisis deriving from the pandemic and more recently the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia.

CGD's executive committee reaffirmed its intention to continue with a sale, as opposed to a liquidation process, owing to the likelihood of its value destruction capacity for the group in the immediate future and it is currently assessing the circumstances and terms in which this may be carried out in accordance with its objectives and its shareholder's best interests.

Based on an incidental review of its commitments to DGComp under the recapitalisation process, Caixa Geral de Depósitos, S.A. decided to dispose of its equity stake in Banco Comercial do Atlântico in the Republic of Cape Verde (BCA) in January 2019 and embarked upon the process and development of the respective legal and procedural steps. Decree law 146/2019, approving the terms governing CGD's total or partial disposal of its equity shares in BCA, was published in September 2019. Several steps have been taken since then with a view to selecting potential investors as a precondition for the evolution of the negotiating process.

The group reversed the reclassification of the assets and liabilities of Banco Comercial do Atlântico (Cape Verde) from "Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures", until then classified under IFRS 5 - "Non-current assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations", in November 2021 as the disposal process on BCA, in progress since 2019 was considered to have been unsuccessful, with the conditions of IFRS 5 for retaining this subsidiary as a non-current asset held-for-sale no longer being met.

In September 2022 CGD was notified by the secretary of state of the treasury (ministerial ruling no. 267/2022-SET) of the authorisation to relaunch the sales process with the aim of identifying and selecting potential investors and receiving expressions of interest in the form of non-binding offers (NBOs). As a result of these guidelines, the executive committee, on November 14, 2022, considered the results of the market research undertaken by Caixa-BI having approved the relaunch of the sales process and its implementation schedule, pursuant to which, at December 31, 2022, the conditions for recognising BCA as a non-current asset held-for-sale under IFRS 5 had been met, with the group having reclassified the assets and liabilities of Banco Comercial do Atlântico (Cape Verde) to "Non-current assets and liabilities held-for-sale subsidiaries" under IFRS 5 - "Non-current assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations".

Additionally, as a result of the application of IFRS 5 to BCA, the profit and loss account was restated to accommodate the effects of this standard. Information on the effects of these modifications is given in the following table:

Esegur, S.A.
The integration method used to include Esegur as the group entity which is now recognised as non-current assets held-for-sale under IFRS 5 was changed in June 2022 and it is no longer accounted for by the equity accounting method.

Caixa's equity stake in Esegur was sold to the Spanish group Trablisa on July 28, 2022 after the necessary authorisations had been obtained. No additional impact was recognised in the group's accounts as its book value had already been reflected in the estimated amount of the sale.

# Foreign currency reserves 

As referred to in note 2.6., at the time of the disposal of the equity stakes denominated in a functional currency other than the euro, profit and loss on the exchange rates previously recognised in "Other reserves" are transferred to profit and loss for the period as they constitute an integral part of the profit or loss made on the transaction. For this purpose and in light of the requirements of IAS 21 - "The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates", operations classified as a reimbursement of the amount invested, and, namely, when comprising share capital reductions, are also considered to be reductions of an interest in subsidiaries. The foreign currency reserves to be reclassified to profit and loss, in such cases, are measured by the proportion of the amount of the reimbursement to the total amount invested.

Accumulated profit and loss on foreign exchange operations at December 31, 2022, recognised as a charge to "Other reserves" in the consolidation of subsidiaries classified as non-current assets and liabilities held-for-sale, comprises losses of approximately $€ 72,393$ thousand ( $€ 79,103$ thousand at December 31, 2021).

## Property and equipment

As referred to in note 2.10, non-current assets held-for-sale also include property and other assets received on credit recovery operations.

Information on the above asset movements for 2022 and 2021 is set out below:
![img-37.jpeg](img-37.jpeg)

Net income from non-current assets and liabilities held-for-sale, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, amounted to $€ 17,191$ thousand and $€ 24,879$ thousand, respectively (note 34), of which $€ 1,979$ thousand and $€ 2,226$ thousand, respectively, for the costs of maintaining the referred to assets in the period up to their disposal.

Impairment for the amount of around $€ 24,125$ thousand was used in 2022 following the sale of 2 properties (note 38).

# 15. Investment properties 

Investment properties owned by the group, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are recognised at fair value. Profit and loss on the revaluation of such properties are recognised as a charge to "Other operating income" (note 2.9) in profit and loss.

In December 2021, CGD disposed of a significant part of its position in the Fundiestamo fund, - from 78\% to $45.4 \%$ - in December 2021. However, as CGD's investment units do not enable it to control or significantly influence the relevant activities associated with the management of the fund's assets its holding in the fund has been excluded from CGD group's consolidation perimeter under IFRS 10. On December 31, 2022, under the heading "Investment Properties" were registered the properties owned by Fliptrel, within the scope of the conclusion of the Crow operation. Under this operation, CGD became the owner of the companies FlitPtrel IV, S.A. and FlitPtrel Porto Santo, S.A. (referred to as "carve-out" assets), which became part of the CGD Group.

The other properties recognised in this account essentially derive from overdue credit recoveries.
Measurement methodologies and fair value appraisals
The measurement of the fair value of investment properties, in addition to other relevant factors, takes into consideration the type, characteristics and geographies of the properties, with the objective of determining the best price to be achieved on their disposal under normal market conditions. Fair value is assessed by appraisers who should employ at least two of the following methods:

- Market comparison method: The market comparison method estimates the transaction price of a specific asset based on prices and other relevant information on market deals involving identical or comparable (similar) properties. It generally employs statistical methods after the various items of market data obtained have been harmonised. This is the principal method used whenever there is information on a significant number of transactions;
- Income method: The income method estimates the value of an item of property by capitalising the annual amount of rents or annual operating income from the activity being performed in the building. When, over time, changes in income are likely to be more significant than generally expected in the market, the discounted cash flows (DCF) technique is used. The income method is applied in the case of the effective rental of a property, when the property is for rent, when the rental market for the type of property being valued is active or when the property is to be exploited economically;
- Cost method: The cost method estimates the value of property on the basis of the amount which would currently be needed to obtain alternative property, as a replica of the original or with an equivalent use, adjusted for obsolescence. It is calculated on the basis of the sum of the acquisition cost of the land and construction costs (including charges) and depreciated on the basis of a property's present physical, functional, environmental and economic conditions plus marketing costs and its developer's margin/risk. This is the principal method used when there is no market information available on transactions of similar property and no potential income associated with it is identifiable;

- Residual worth method: The residual worth method estimates the residual worth of land, constructions to be rehabilitated or unfinished properties, net of the presumed sales price of the finished property, obtained by the market method and all costs and margins associated with the unfinished construction.

The availability of relevant data and its relative subjectivity may affect the choice of valuation method/techniques. The choice, in this case, should particularly focus on those which maximise the use of relevant observable variables.

The most relevant variables considered for each of the above referred to valuation methods are as follows:
(i) Market comparison method

- This is the presumed sales price per sqm or presumed sales price per unit (when what is relevant is not the area but rather the use given to the property e.g. parking spaces). In liquid markets, these variables are provided by directly or indirectly observable data in the transaction market, although they may need to be adjusted (harmonised) depending on the specific characteristics of the property in question.
(ii) Income method
- Capitalisation technique
- This is the amount of the monthly rent per sqm or monthly rent per unit (when what is relevant is not the area but rather the use given to the property, e.g. parking spaces). In active rental markets, these variables are provided by directly or indirectly observable data in the said market, although they may need to be adjusted (harmonised) depending on the specific characteristics of the property in question.
- Variables contributing to the assessment of operating income from the property. These variables may differ in line with the type of property and are generally assessed on the basis of a property's potential income generating capacity, taking into account the information available on the assumptions of market actors. The data supplied by the entity operating the property may be used in the absence of any reasonably available information indicating that market actors would not employ different assumptions.
- Capitalisation rate. This is associated with the risk on capital invested, income, liquidity, tax burden, risk-free interest rate, expected market evolution. In active markets, it establishes the linear relationship at a certain point of time between the rental and purchase/sales market for a certain geography and a specific property product segment, with an identical risk and identical evolution of rents.
- Discounted cash flow technique
- Diverse variables may contribute to the estimated cash flow based on the type of property. This technique is reliant on current expectations of changes in the amounts and times of future cash flows. The inclusion of a risk adjustment factor based on the uncertainty of this type of measurement is usually required.
- Discount rate. This is considered to be the value of money over time, associated with a riskfree interest rate and the price to be paid on the uncertainty involved in cash flows (risk premium).
(iii) Cost method
- Construction cost per sqm. This variable is essentially reliant upon a property's construction characteristics although the place of construction is also taken into account. It is based on directly or indirectly observable construction market data.

Investment properties acquired on credit recovery operations are also included in the analysis of the individual and collective impairment valuation model on property recognised as non-current assets held-forsale, whose principal characteristics are described in note 2.8. The respective fair value, in these cases, is measured by reference to the assessment of the respective recoverable amount.

To meet the requirements of IFRS 13 - "Fair value measurement", the following table provides information on the investment properties in the group's portfolio, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, by type, development status in terms of preparation for use and current occupancy, considering the methodologies used to measure fair value:

"Intangible assets" movements in 2022 and 2021 were as follows:
![img-38.jpeg](img-38.jpeg)

Intangible assets in progress, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, essentially refer to the development costs of software which had still not come into operation on the said dates.

Write-offs of automatic data processing systems in 2022 and 2021 derived from discontinuations or obsolescence.

Accumulated impairment on intangible assets, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 amounted to $€ 15,450$ thousand and $€ 13,037$ thousand, respectively (note 38).

Changes in gross value and impairment on goodwill in respect of Banco Caixa Geral Angola across the period derive from foreign exchange revaluations.

CGD spent $€ 48,016$ thousand and $€ 60,968$ thousand, on research, development and innovation projects, in 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The group received dividends of $€ 6,471$ thousand and $€ 3,370$ thousand from these entities in 2022 and in 2021 respectively.

The integration method used to include Esegur as the group entity which was recognised as non-current assets held-for-sale under IFRS 5 was changed in June 2022 and it is no longer accounted for by the equity accounting method. CGD's equity stake in Esegur was sold to the Spanish group Trablisa on July 28, 2022. No additional impact was recognised in the group's accounts as its book value had already been reflected in the estimated amount of the sale.

The "Other" column, in 2021 includes $€ 689$ thousand deriving from the transfer of BCA's assets and liabilities from non-current assets and liabilities held-for-sale categories (note 14) pursuant to the discontinuation of the application of IFRS 5 - "Non-current assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations" to this business unit.

As described in greater detail in note 14, the group discontinued its application of IFRS 5 - "Non-current assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations" on BCA in November 2021.

In September 2022 CGD was notified by the secretary of state of the treasury (ministerial ruling no. 267/2022-SET) of the authorisation to relaunch the sales process with the aim of identifying and selecting potential investors and receiving expressions of interest in the form of non-binding offers (NBOs). As a result of these guidelines, at December 31, 2022, the conditions for recognising BCA as a non-current asset held-for-sale under IFRS 5 had been met, with the group having reclassified the assets and liabilities of Banco Comercial do Atlântico (Cape Verde) to "Non-current assets and liabilities held-for-sale - subsidiaries" under IFRS 5 - "Non-current assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations".

# Special regime applicable to deferred tax assets 

Caixa Geral de Depósitos and Caixa - Banco de Investimento subscribed for the special deferred tax assets regime, in 2014, following the resolutions in favour of their respective general meetings of shareholders.

This regime (and latter amendments), approved by law 61/2014 of August 26, includes deferred tax assets on the non-deduction of costs and negative equity changes with impairment losses on loans (as provided for in nos. 1 and 2 of article 28-A of the IRC code and respective exclusions) and its employees' postemployment or long term benefits.

Amendments to the regime brought in by law 23/2016 of August 19, excluded the costs and negative equity changes accounted for in the taxation periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016, in addition to their associated deferred taxes from the scope of its timeframe. The deferred taxes protected by this regime therefore solely correspond to the assessment of costs and negative equity changes calculated up to December 31, 2015.

Deferred tax assets resulting from the non-deduction of costs and negative equity changes with impairment losses on loans and employees' post-employment or long term benefits are converted into tax credit when the taxpayer's net results in the respective tax period are negative or in the event of a voluntary liquidation or court-ordered insolvency. In the case of a conversion resulting from negative net results, the amount of the tax credit to be attributed will be the result of the proportion of such negative net results for the period to the taxpayer's total equity (assessed prior to the deduction of the result) plus the amount of CoCo bonds, applied to the eligible deferred tax assets balance. In cases in which the conversion is the result of liquidation or insolvency or the taxpayer has negative equity, the full amount of the deferred tax assets is converted into tax credit.

In cases of conversions into tax credit (other than in cases of liquidation or insolvency), a special reserve, plus $10 \%$, is set up for the amount of the respective credit and adjusted when equity is less than share capital by the quotient between the former and latter which is deducted from the amount of the increased tax credit, together with the issuance of securities in the form of conversion rights to be attributed to the state that, in the case of CGD, is, at the same time, its sole shareholder. The consequence of exercising conversion rights is to increase the taxpayer's share capital through the incorporation of the special reserve and issuance of new ordinary shares for free delivery to the state. This special reserve cannot be distributed. On the date of

the issuance of the conversion rights, shareholders enjoy the potestative right to their acquisition in proportion to their respective investment.

Information on the type of deferred tax assets recognised by the group and considered eligible under this regime, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, is set out below:

| Deferred tax within the scope of the special <br> regime for deferred tax assets | $31-12-2022$ | $31-12-2021$ |
| :-- | --: | --: |
| Impairment losses on credit | 49,365 | 305,706 |
| Employee benefits | 53,595 | 59,318 |
|  | 102,959 | 365,024 |

As a consequence of Caixa Geral de Depósitos' assessment of negative net results from its separate activity in 2016, the eligible deferred tax assets at the close of the referred to period were converted into tax credit, based on the proportion of its net results to shareholders' equity and amounting to $€ 420,575$ thousand. As already stated the amount of the tax credit was settled in full in December 31, 2022.

Under applicable legislation, the conversion of deferred tax assets was preceded by the creation of a special reserve of $€ 681,571$ thousand, for the amount of the tax credit calculated under the conversion, plus 10\% and adjusted to meet the requirements of no. 3 of article 11 of law 61/2014 (note 28). The creation of the special reserve was accompanied by the issuance and simultaneous attribution of conversion rights for an equivalent amount to the state. The above referred to corporate acts, in addition to the amount of the tax credit conversion were certified by a statutory auditor as specified in article 12 of the appendix to law 61/2014 (of which it is an integral part).

Owing to its status as CGD's sole shareholder, the issuance and attribution of conversion rights to the state did not entail any dilution of its equity status.

In compliance with the provisions of ministerial order no. 293-A/2016 of November 18, according to the wording of ministerial order no. 272/2017 of September 13 and pursuant to ministerial ruling no. 2445/2019 issued by the then minister of finance, Caixa deposited $€ 681,571$ thousand (note 20) in the name of the directorate general of the treasury and finance, as holder of the conversion rights on behalf of the state, for the exact amount of the call price of the potestative right to acquire the full amount of the conversion rights. The amount of the deposit will be returned to CGD after the formalisation of the conversion act on the rights and consequent share capital increase in the form of an incorporation of the special reserve.

# Income tax as a charge to shareholders' equity 

The group altered its accounting policy on the recognition of actuarial profit and loss on pension plans and other post-employment benefits in 2011, pursuant to which actuarial profit and loss on revaluations of pensions and healthcare liabilities and pension fund yield projections were fully recognised as a charge to a shareholders' equity account. Up to 2010 such profit and loss had been accounted for by the corridor method.

The amount of tax on the contribution of the actuarial deviations component after the date of the accounting policy change, considered deductible under the terms of the limits of numbers 2 and 3 of article 43 of the IRC code, or under number 8 of the referred to article is recognised in an equity account, in conformity with the recognition basis of its originating liabilities.

Income tax as a charge to profit and loss
Information on income tax costs recognised in profit and loss for the periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, in addition to the fiscal burden, measured by the tax appropriation to net profit for the period before tax ratio, is set out below:

| Consolidated income before tax | $1,130,198$ | 851,616 |
| Tax charge | $24.01 \%$ | $32.12 \%$ |

The breakdown of "Adjustments for past years" for the periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 is as follows:

| Adjustments to previous years taxable income | $(2,669)$ | $(1,327)$ |
|  | 3,320 | 20,533 |

The "Insufficiency/(excess) of estimated tax" for the amount of $€ 5,988$ thousand at December 31, 2022, mainly refers to temporary differences determined in the calculation of IRC for 2021, adjustable to the taxable income of future years. These differences led to the constitution of deferred taxes for the same period.

The reconciliation between the amount of tax calculated on the basis of the nominal rate and the costs/(income) with tax on profit for the periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was as follows:

CGD's nominal tax rate, for the period ended December 31, 2022, considering the surcharge rates applicable to its operations was $27.35 \%$.

The assessment of CGD's nominal tax rate considers the increase in the municipal and state surcharges on taxable profit.

Article 51-C of the IRC code was altered by the publication of law 42/2016, on the basis of an addendum to no. 6 , which rules, for 2017 and following years, that impairment losses and other value adjustments to equity investments or other own equity instruments included as part of taxable profit under no. 2 of article 28 -A, are considered to be positive components of taxable profit for the taxation period in which the respective sale has taken place.

The group has accordingly recognised deferred tax liabilities for impairment on financial investments, deductible as a tax expense at the time of the constitution thereof when the intention involves a sale or liquidation (or when in progress), for the amounts of $€ 42,776$ thousand and $€ 30,055$ thousand, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

Limitations on tax deductions of impairment losses on loans and other value adjustments (note 2.13)
Law 98/2019, amending the IRC code on impairment in credit institutions and other financial institutions and establishing rules on impairment losses recognised in tax periods prior to January 1, 2019, not yet accepted as a fiscal cost, was published on September 4, 2019. Under this new regime, impairment losses on credit risk for exposures analysed on an individual or collective basis, recognised in tax periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 in accordance with the applicable accounting and regulatory standards (with the exceptions provided for in no. 7 of article $28-\mathrm{C}$ of the IRC code) are fully deductible.

The rules in force up to December 31, 2018 continue to apply to impairment losses and other value adjustments for specific credit risk accounted for in prior tax periods, i.e. limiting tax deductions to the

amounts assessed under the provisions of Bank of Portugal notice 3/95 (latterly revoked) provided that such loans were not collateralised by real rights over immovable assets.

According to the provisions of article 4 of the new law, CGD and the other relevant entities included in the national fiscal perimeter formalised their intention to subscribe for the new regime for the tax periods beginning January 1, 2019, in the form of a communication addressed to the director general of the tax and customs authority on October 31, 2019.

The applicable deduction rules under the referred to law were incorporated into the analysis of the recoverability of deferred tax assets recognised in the balance sheet.

Analysis of recoverability of deferred tax assets (note 2.13)
Based on the requirements of IAS 12 - "Income taxes", deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent of the group's expectations of their future recoverability which is fundamentally based on:
(i) an assessment of its capacity to generate sufficient taxable profit, and,
(ii) an interpretation of the legal framework in force in the relevant analysis period.

This evaluation was carried out on the basis of exercises projecting the activities listed in the strategic objectives submitted to the shareholder to be implemented across the current term of office of the board of directors, allowing CGD, over the referred to timeframe, to achieve adequate profitability and capital levels and the non-performing asset reduction targets reported to the supervisory entities.

The potential impacts on CGD's activity owing to the evolution of the pandemic on national and global economic development and its undeniable effects on its capacity to achieve the desired economic and financial goals were also considered.

Expectations of generating future taxable profits are based on profitability projections which have been duly adjusted to the evolution of the relevant macroeconomic and financial indicators.

The following assumptions of relevance to the conclusions on the recoverability of deferred tax assets were also considered:
(i) The application of deduction rules on impairment on credit risk as defined by law 98/2019;
(ii) The incorporation of the estimated fiscal profit/loss deriving from the restructuring strategy on international operations and the deleveraging process on non-performing assets agreed with the supervisory bodies; and
(iii) The projected deduction of the costs of present and future employee benefits based on the tax period in which the respective payments are likely to be made.

Another significant aspect for defining the assumptions of the recoverability exercise derived from the amendment of the IRC code by law 24-D/2023, which approves the state budget for 2023, as regards the elimination of the timeframe for future tax loss carry-overs, combined with the reduction of the annual deduction limit from taxable profit to $65 \%$ of taxable income (previously, 70\%). This amendment applies to the deduction of tax losses in tax periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, in addition to the losses made in previous periods whose deduction period is still in progress on the said date.

For this purpose and notwithstanding the elimination of the timeframe for the carry-back of tax losses, CGD considered that its analysis of the annual limit for the deduction of the accrued tax losses balance available at December 31, 2022 should include a maximum period of 5 years, as it considered that projections over longer periods are subject to greater factors of uncertainty and volatility. Following this analysis it was concluded that the tax losses originating in 2017, which were previously unrecognised owing to the unlikelihood of the existence of sufficient taxable income for deduction purposes, will now be recoverable. Following this conclusion, the respective deferred taxes, resulting in gains of $€ 62,668$ thousand for the period were recognised. Deferred taxes of $€ 17,362$ thousand for tax credit on international double taxation regarding the activity of the overseas branches for past years were also recognised.

No losses were estimated for the remaining deferred taxes recognised in the balance sheet. Any alterations to the assumptions used or the variables pertaining to the determination of taxable profit projections could lead to substantially different results and conclusions.

Owing to the uncertainties deriving from the outbreak of armed conflict in the European territorial space in February 2022 and its undeniably profound geopolitical dimension and impacts, the type of exercise

performed and the robustness of its results enable the board of directors, according to the data currently at its disposal, to continue to consider the results obtained as being valid.

# Banking sector and additional solidarity contribution 

Article 141 of the state budget law for 2011 (law 55-A/2010 of December 31), introduced a new contribution regime for the banking sector. This contribution, regulated under the terms of ministerial order 121/2011 of March 30, is levied on an institution's liabilities, net of the own and complementary funds therein included, in addition to the deposits covered by the deposit guarantee fund and the notional amount of derivatives other than hedge derivatives. The tax is also levied on the subsidiaries of credit institutions headquartered outside Portuguese territory and the branches in Portugal of credit institutions headquartered outside the European Union.

This regime was expanded in 2020 to include a "solidarity" component levied on the banking sector as a fiscal policy instrument in response to the pandemic crisis. The basis upon which the contribution is levied is regulated by ministerial order 191/2020 of August 10, whose requirements are the same as those applicable to the assessment of the previously referred to banking sector contribution.

The group recognised costs of $€ 37,104$ thousand and $€ 28,733$ thousand, for the periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 respectively, for the total amount payable by it in the respective taxation periods.

The tax authorities are normally entitled to review the tax situation across a certain period, which, in Portugal, is four years (unless tax losses have been carried back, in addition to any other deduction or tax credit expiring in the same year as this right). Different interpretations of the legislation may result in the eventual possibility of adjustments to taxable profit for past years (considering that inspections were carried out on most entities headquartered in Portugal and included in the group's fiscal perimeter by the tax authorities in 2017 and 2018 although the fiscal years 2019 to 2021 are still subject to inspection), any possible adjustments, given the nature thereof, cannot be quantified at present. CGD's board of directors considers, however, that any adjustments for the above years are unlikely to have a significant effect on its consolidated financial statements.

The "Debtors and other assets - other debtors" account at December 31, 2022 included a deposit of $€ 681,571$ thousand on behalf of the directorate general for the treasury and finance, as part of the deferred taxes to fiscal credit conversion process (note 19).

The "Debtors and other assets - other debtors" account, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, includes $€ 23,091$ thousand and $€ 241,148$ thousand, respectively, for surety accounts in several financial institutions. The referred to sureties derive from the liquidity injection operations collateralised by financial assets and interest rate swap (IRS) agreements with such entities (note 10). The change derives from the evolution of the fair value of the underlying transactions.

The "Debtors and other assets - other debtors" account, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, includes $€ 26,279$ thousand and $€ 22,575$ thousand, respectively, for sureties in the form of an irrevocable commitment to make contributions to the European single resolution fund (note 34).

Under the contract to issue notes between Banco Nacional Ultramarino, S.A. (Macau) and the Administrative Region of Macau, the bank provides the region with convertible currency for the countervalue of notes in circulation and, in turn, receives a debt certificate for an equivalent amount to cover the liability resulting from the currency issuance (note 26). The amounts to be provided by the bank to the region are reconciled in the first fifteen days of each month, based on the preceding month's average daily balances. The debt certificate of the Macau government, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, totalled €1,336,301 thousand and $€ 1,239,001$ thousand, respectively.

The "Debtors and other assets - other overdue debtors" account at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 includes outstanding balances for the execution of guarantees provided to customers and other costs directly associated with such operations for the amounts of $€ 12,654$ thousand and $€ 15,896$ thousand, respectively.

The "Central banks' resources - resources - European Central Bank - Loans, deposits and other resources - Caixa Geral de Depósitos" account at December 31, 2021 refers to CGD's participation in the 3rd series of the targeted longer term refinancing programme (TLTRO) created by the ECB to assist eurozone financial institutions in their lending to the economy on favourable terms and as a preferred instrument for the implementation of its monetary policy.

The operation was recognised under IFRS 9 requirements in accordance with ECB administrative variablerate financing. Each alteration to programme rates therefore has the effect of altering the effective interest rate on the financing, whose impacts are recognised prospectively.

There have been several adaptations regarding participation in and conditions governing interest on the third TLTRO series, announced on March 7, 2019, initially for operations with a maturity of two and subsequently changed to three years, with quarterly auctions. Access to funding by financial institutions could extend to up to $55 \%$ of a specific set of their loans (for all of the 10 operations provided for under the programme). Interest was payable on the basis of the average interest rate level on the main refinancing operations (MRO).

CGD repaid $€ 5,800,000$ thousand in funding obtained from the ECB (third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations - TLTRO-III) under Eurosystem monetary policy measures, in the last quarter of 2022.

The net impact of the referred to operations in the net interest income aggregate (note 30) in the financial statements for the period was $€ 49,059$ thousand.

|  | 3,000,000 | 3,000,000 |

CGD uses the following specific programmes to diversify its funding sources:
(i) Euro Commercial Paper and Certificates of Deposits (ECP e CCP)

Under the " $€ 10,000,000,000$ euro commercial paper and certificates of deposit" programme, CGD (either directly or through its France branch) may issue certificates of deposit (CDs) and notes with a maximum maturity of 5 years and 1 year, respectively, denominated in euros, US dollars, sterling, Japanese yen or another currency agreed between the parties. Fixed or variable-rate interest is payable on these issuances which may also be indexed to the performance of indices or shares.
(ii) Euro Medium Term Notes (EMTN)

CGD group, through CGD (either directly or through its France branch) may issue a maximum amount of $€ 15,000,000$ thousand in debt securities under this programme.

Bonds with minimum maturities of one month and 5 years for non-subordinated and subordinated issuances, respectively, may be issued in any currency. No maximum maturities on these operations have been defined.

These securities may be issued at a discount. Fixed or variable-rate interest is payable on these issuances which may also be indexed to the performance of indices or shares.

(iii) Covered bonds

CGD set up a covered bonds programme, for direct issuance, up to a current maximum amount of $€ 15,000,000$ thousand in November 2006. The bonds to be issued are backed by a mortgage loans bonds portfolio which must, at all times, comply with the minimum conditions required by the regulation applicable to issuances of such instruments, in the form of decree law 59/2006, Bank of Portugal notices 5, 6, 7 and 8 and instruction 13.

The bonds may be issued in any currency with a minimum maturity of 2 and maximum maturity of 50 years. Fixed or variable-rate interest is payable on these issuances which may also be indexed to the performance of indices or shares.

These bonds entitle their holders to special credit rights - over any other creditors - on assets which have been set aside in the issuing entity's balance sheet to guarantee the debt and to which bondholders enjoy access in the event of insolvency.

Assets eligible for the creation of an asset pool comprise residential mortgage or commercial loans in a European Union member state or, alternatively, loans and advances to central governments or the regional and local authorities of one of the European Union member states and loans with the express and legally binding guarantee of such entities. Mortgage loans cannot exceed $80 \%$ of the value of the mortgaged assets given as collateral for residential property ( $60 \%$ for other property).

In accordance with the issuance conditions defined under the programme, the following criteria must also be complied with across the period of the issuance:

- The total nominal value of covered bonds in circulation may not exceed $95 \%$ of the total amount of mortgage loans and other assets allocated to the referred to bonds;
- The average maturity of covered bonds issuances may not, for issuances as a whole, exceed the average life of the associated mortgage loans;
- The total amount of interest payable by the covered bonds may not, for issuances as a whole, exceed the amount of interest charged to borrowers of the mortgage loans allocated to the referred to bonds; and
- The present value of the covered bonds may not exceed the present value of the assets allocated to them, which ratio must be maintained for parallel shifts of 200 basis points on the yield curve.

A maximum of $20 \%$ of the assets pool may also include autonomous assets in the form of deposits at the Bank of Portugal or securities eligible for Eurosystem credit and other operations defined by law.

The nominal value of CGD's covered bonds issuances at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, totalled €3,000,000 thousand and $€ 4,250,000$ thousand, respectively, with the following characteristics:

(a) Issue is fully repurchased by CGD. These securities are outstanding liquidity and voting operations with the European Central Bank.

The assets pool used to collateralise the issuances comprises mortgage loans originating in Portugal with a book value of $€ 4,085,921$ thousand and $€ 5,604.258$ thousand respectively (note 13), at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

The assets pool used as collateral for the issuances also comprised debt securities, with a book value of $€ 15,000$ thousand and $€ 15,097$ thousand respectively (note 12), at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

The Fitch and DBRS ratings on these covered bonds issuances, at December 31, 2022 were A and AA, respectively.

CGD launched a €500,000 thousand senior preferred debt issuance on September 21, 2021, with a maximum maturity of 6 years at a coupon rate of $0.375 \%$, which is the lowest ever achieved by the group in its capital market issuances. This issuance has the particularity of being sustainable in targeting the funds raised to the financing of its customers' credit operations in the environmental and socio-economic domain. This is the first time a Portuguese bank has launched an issuance with these characteristics.

Similarly, on June 15, 2022, CGD launched another "green" or senior preferred debt issuance for the amount of $€ 300,000$ thousand, with a maturity of 4 years and an early redemption option after 3 years at a coupon rate of $2.875 \%$.

On October 31, 2022, CGD launched another "green" or senior preferred debt issuance for the amount of $€ 500,000$ thousand, with a maturity of 6 years and an early redemption option after 5 years at a coupon rate of $5.75 \%$.

The referred to issuances are part of the funding plan defined for compliance with MREL (minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities) as defined by the Bank of Portugal and decided by the single resolution board. These issuances were sold on international debt markets for this purpose, following the senior non-preferred debt issuance of November 2019 and increasingly represent an important milestone in implementing sustainable financing commitments, creating value and reducing the environmental impact of its activity.

Asset-backed guarantees refer to debt instruments which, based on their type, are recognised in assets at fair value through profit or loss, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, loans and advances to customers and debt securities accounts (note 23).

Asset-backed guarantees are not available for CGD's free use in its operations and are recognised at their nominal value in off-balance sheet accounts.

The market value of debt instruments given as collateral, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 totalled $€ 10,512,516$ thousand and $€ 18,850,580$ thousand, respectively of which amount $€ 2,949,308$ thousand and $€ 2,970,599$ thousand comprised debt repurchases.

The market value of securities collateralising the group's term liabilities for its annual contributions to the deposit guarantee fund and investors' indemnity system at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, was $€ 204,787$ thousand and $€ 202,084$ thousand, respectively.

The deposit guarantee fund aims to guarantee customers' deposits in conformity with the limits defined by the general credit institutions and financial corporations regime. This takes the form of regular annual contributions. In past years a part of the liabilities comprised an irrevocable commitment to make the referred to contributions when requested by the fund, with the amount not having been recognised as a cost. Commitments assumed since 1996 total $€ 155,553$ thousand. The group recognised liabilities of $€ 1,940$ thousand and $€ 1,447$ thousand for its annual contribution to the deposit guarantee fund at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 respectively.

# Competition authority 

On June 3, 2015, CGD, together with fourteen other credit institutions, was charged by the competition authority, with performing certain practices, namely exchanging information with several of the said credit institutions, which, in the eyes of the said authority, comprised collusion with the aim of significantly distorting market competition.

Based on the requests submitted by several of the referred to credit institutions, the initial period was extended on more than one occasion and has still not expired. CGD has, nevertheless, prepared its defence to comply with the initial period which expired on November 17, 2015.

On March 14, 2017, CGD was formally notified by the competition authority of its board of directors' resolution to lift the suspension regarding the current offence, while retaining the suspending of the response time. A new resolution latterly passed by the competition authority's board of directors terminated the suspension of the response time, ending September 27, 2017. CGD submitted its defence on September 26, having for the purpose, requested complementary evidentiary hearings which took place on December 5 and 6,2017 .

In June, July and October 2018, CGD responded to the competition authority's requests for additional elements.

In March 2019, CGD was notified of the competition authority's resolution to extend the process's investigation period up to December 31, 2020.

CGD was notified of the competition authority's unprecedented final decision on September 10, 2019 in which a fine of $€ 82,000$ thousand was levied (calculated, by law, on its business revenue in the credit segments in question). The other institutions involved in this process were also notified of similar decisions.

CGD considers that the charges concerning the alleged breaches and the fine levied on it contain errors and omissions and therefore contested them with the competition, regulation and supervision court on October 21, 2019.

Pursuant to the above a bank guarantee of $€ 41,000$ thousand was put up on December 21, 2020 owing to the court's consideration of the need thereof for the purpose of suspending the execution of the fine. This decision is, however, being contested by CGD.

The trial began on October 6, 2021 and the hearing reopened on April 8, 2022, after the final allegations made by the parties. The reopening of the hearing was determined by the presiding judge for the purpose of altering non-substantial facts in relation to those contained in the charge. On April 28, 2022, the court decided to refer a number of questions concerning the interpretation of European Union law to the court of justice of the European Union for a preliminary ruling pursuant to which the infringement procedure has been suspended until the court of justice has issued its decision.

## Resolution fund

The resolution fund was created by decree law 31-A/2012 of February 10. It is funded by resources from the contributions of the institutions participating in the fund and the banking sector contribution. Other means of funding may also be used whenever such resources are shown to be insufficient to meet liabilities, namely:
(i) Special contributions from credit institutions; and;

(ii) Amounts deriving from loans.

# Resolution measure on Banco Espírito Santo, S.A. 

On August 3, 2014, the board of trustees of the Bank of Portugal decided to apply a resolution measure on Banco Espírito Santo, S.A. (BES), pursuant to which most of BES's activity and assets were transferred to Novo Banco S.A., as a new transitional banking institution created for the purpose and fully owned by the resolution fund.

Following the resolution measure, Novo Banco, S.A. was deemed to have capital requirements of $€ 4,900,000$ thousand to be paid up by the sole shareholder under the terms of the legislation in force. Considering that the resolution fund's own resources for the operation at the said date were insufficient, the capital was subscribed for on the basis of two loans:

- €3,900,000 thousand from the Portuguese state; and
- €700,000 thousand from eight fund member institutions (of which €174,000 thousand from CGD).

In September 2015 the Bank of Portugal suspended the sales process on the resolution fund's equity stake in Novo Banco, initiated in 2014 and completed the process in progress without accepting any of the three binding proposals received, considering that the terms and conditions thereof were not satisfactory. In its announcement of December 21, 2015 the Bank of Portugal disclosed information on the agreement reached with the European Commission, providing for, inter alia, an extension to the period for the full disposal of the resolution fund's equity stake in Novo Banco.

On December 29, 2015 the Bank of Portugal announced the approval of a series of decisions to complete the resolution measure applied to BES. The Bank of Portugal decided to reassign liability for the nonsubordinated bonds issued by it for institutional investors to BES. The nominal amount of the bonds reassigned to BES was $€ 1,941,000$ thousand, comprising a balance sheet carrying amount of $€ 1,985,000$ thousand. The Bank of Portugal also clarified that in addition to this measure, the resolution fund is responsible for neutralising any negative effects of future decisions resulting in liabilities or contingencies deriving from the resolution process, by compensating Novo Banco.

The disposal process on the resolution fund's equity stake in Novo Banco was re-launched in January 2016.
In July 2016, deriving from the completion of the independent appraisal process on the recovery of loans in each category of BES creditors, in a hypothetical liquidation scenario in August 2014, as an alternative to the implementation of the resolution measure, the Bank of Portugal clarified that, in the event of the closure or liquidation of BES, its creditors whose loans had not been transferred to Novo Banco, S.A., would incur a greater loss than would otherwise have been the case and should be compensated for the difference by the resolution fund.

On August 4, 2016, the resolution fund announced an alteration of the conditions of the loans obtained to fund the implementation of the resolution measure (both with a maximum maturity of August 4, 2016) which would now mature at December 31, 2017, without prejudice to early redemption or agreement to further alterations.

On September 28, 2016, the resolution fund announced that it had reached agreement with the ministry of finance on a review of the conditions attached to the loans obtained to fund the BES resolution measure. According to the resolution fund's announcement, the agreed review "would permit an extension of the maturity for the purpose of guaranteeing the resolution fund's capacity to fully comply with its obligations based on its regular revenue, notwithstanding any positive or negative contingencies to which the resolution fund is exposed." On the same date, the office of the ministry of finance also announced that: "under the agreement with the resolution fund and bases already established, any increases or reductions of liabilities deriving from any future contingencies, shall entail an adjustment to the maturity of the state's and banks' loans to the resolution fund, with the contributions required from the banking sector remaining at their current levels."

On March 21, 2017 the resolution fund announced the formalisation of the above referred to contractual alterations, including an extension of the maturity period to December 31, 2046. The objective behind the review of the loan conditions was to ensure the resolution fund's sustainability and financial balance, based on stable, foreseeable, manageable costs for the banking sector.

On March 31, 2017, the Bank of Portugal selected Lone Star for the completion of the Novo Banco sales operation. The agreement entailed two capital increases, the first of which for $€ 750,000$ thousand in October of the said year and the second for $€ 250,000$ thousand in December 2017.

The sale was preceded by a liability management exercise (LME) on 36 bond series with a book value of $€ 3,000,000$ thousand. The success of this operation translated into the purchase and redemption of bonds representing $73 \%$ of book value, with immediate proceeds of $€ 209,700$ thousand.

The sales process was followed by the creation of a contingent capital mechanism enabling Novo Banco to receive compensation of up to $€ 3,890,000$ thousand on the recognition of any losses on its assets under resolution fund management.

On October 18, 2017, the resolution fund complied with the operation's final formalities in implementing the resolutions of the Bank of Portugal as the national resolution authority, retaining a 25\% equity stake in Novo Banco with Lone Star taking 75\%. This operation increased Novo Banco's share capital from €4,900,000 thousand to $€ 5,900,000$ thousand.

Following the completion of this operation, Novo Banco ceased to be subject to the transitional institutions regime and now operates normally and in full, albeit subject to several measures limiting its activity imposed by the European competition authority.

On March 28, 2018, following the bank's announcement of its results for 2017, the contingent capitalisation mechanism, provided for in the agreements entered into at the time of sale was activated, requiring the resolution fund to pay $€ 792,000$ thousand to Novo Banco.

The above payment was made on May 24, 2018, following the issuance of Novo Banco's statutory audit certificate and completion of the necessary certification procedures, resulting in confirmation of the existence of the conditions requiring the payment to be made, under the agreement, in addition to the exact amount to be paid by the resolution fund.

The resolution fund, for the said purpose, used its own resources from the contributions paid by the banking sector, complemented by a $€ 430,000$ thousand loan from the Portuguese state.

On July 6, 2018, the resolution fund, at the general meeting of Oitante, held on July 3, approved the submission of a proposal to the Bank of Portugal regarding the appointment of members of the company's board of directors for the 2018-2020 term of office owing to the term of the preceding mandate. A proposal to reappoint the members of the supervisory board of Oitante and the company's statutory auditor in addition to the members of the board of the general meeting was also submitted to the Bank of Portugal. Oitante's accounts for 2017, showing a profit of $€ 30,100$ thousand, were also approved at the same general meeting.

Novo Banco announced its results for 2018 on March 1, 2019. This resulted in the activation of the contingent capitalisation mechanism provided for in the agreements entered into in 2017, in the sphere of the sale of this institution. In conformity with the results announced by Novo Banco, an amount of $€ 1,149,000$ thousand was paid by the resolution fund in 2019.

The amount payable by the resolution fund in 2019 was realised on May 6, 2019. The resolution fund, as in 2018, used its available financial resources from the contributions paid by the banking sector, complemented by a loan of $€ 850,000$ thousand from the Portuguese state.

In its announcement reporting its results for 2019, Novo Banco requested compensation of $€ 1,037,000$ thousand under the contingent capital mechanism, as stipulated in the sales contract. The referred to payment was made in May 2020 for the amount of $€ 1,035,000$ thousand.

The resolution fund also provided the budget and finance committee with a written account of all clarifications on its decision to deduct the variable remuneration allocated to members of Novo Banco's executive board of directors from the amount calculated under the terms of the contingent capital mechanism.

The amount of compensation paid in 2018 ( $€ 792,000$ thousand for 2017), 2019 ( $€ 1,149,000$ thousand for 2018) and 2020 ( $€ 1,035,000$ thousand for 2019) totalled $€ 2,976,000$ thousand. The maximum amount of the payments to be made by the resolution fund as agreed in the contingent capitalisation agreement is $€ 3,890,000$ thousand.

Regarding the information disclosed on June 4, 2020, following the public finance council's publication of its "Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2020-2022", the resolution fund clarified that, in conjunction with Novo Banco, it had entered into an arbitration process for the purpose of clarifying the treatment merited by the effects of Novo Banco's intention to dispense with the transitional regime from which it currently benefits and which was designed to reduce the impact of the introduction of IFRS 9 on credit institutions' own funds, under the contingent capitalisation agreement entered into between both of them.

The referred to arbitration process does not pose an additional risk to the $€ 3,890,000$ thousand limit.

In its announcement of June 16, 2020, the resolution fund provided the budget and finance committee with the contractual documents which include the "Contract for the purchase and sale of and subscriptions for Novo Banco. S.A.'s shares" entered into between the resolution fund and Nani Holdings SGPS, S.A. on March 31, 2017, in addition to the "contingent capitalisation agreement" entered into between the resolution fund and Novo Banco on October 18, 2017.

On August 10, 2020, the resolution fund made an announcement clarifying that the sale of Novo Banco's equity stake in GNB - Companhia de Seguros de Vida, S.A. was an imperative dictated by the Portuguese state's undertakings to the European Commission. Under the terms of the said undertakings, Novo Banco was obligated to sell its equity stake in GNB Vida by December 31, 2019.

The stake was acquired by "APAX Partners" funds whose suitability was assessed by the competent authority. The resolution fund's appraisal considered that the amount of the sale comprised the best offer received following an open and competitive sales process, reflecting the asset's market value at the time.

Following its payment to Novo Banco in May 2019 in compliance with the contingent capitalisation agreement, on September 3, 2020, the resolution fund announced that it had received the special audit report commissioned by the government, under law 15/2019 of February 12, which rules that whenever public funds are directly or indirectly made available to a credit institution, an audit shall be carried out by an independent entity, in this case Deloitte \& Associados, SROC. It also provided for a need identified by the resolution fund in February 2019.

The audit's results show that Novo Banco continues to be severely prejudiced by the vast legacy of nonperforming assets, left by Banco Espírito Santo, S.A., and consequent recognition of impairment and provisions but that it has strengthened its internal procedures. It also confirms the adequacy of the principles and criteria adopted with regard to the resolution fund's powers exercised under the contingent capitalisation agreement.

On June 4, 2021, the resolution fund paid an amount of $€ 317,013$ thousand to Novo Banco in respect of the contingent capitalisation agreement regarding its accounts for 2020. This payment was made on the basis of Novo Banco's request for the payment of $€ 598,312$ thousand, on April 7, 2021. Following the completion of all of the validation procedures, it was confirmed that, with reference to December 31, 2020, the condition determining payment by the resolution fund had been met. The amount necessary for Novo Banco's CET 1 ratio to achieve the contractually stipulated level of $12 \%$ is $€ 598,312$ thousand, which amount was confirmed by the Bank of Portugal and the European Central Bank as the authorities lawfully competent for this purpose.

The resolution fund considered that adjustments should be made to the aggregate amount of $€ 169,299$ thousand requested by Novo Banco. This adjustment derives from the sum of the figures for the following situations:
(i) The reduction of the amount corresponding to the impact, on Novo Banco's capital holding, of the loss resulting from the decision to sell off Novo Banco's activity in Spain, with reference to December 31, 2020 (€147,442 thousand);
(ii) The reduction corresponding to measurement differences on a collection of assets held by Novo Banco ( $€ 18,000$ thousand);
(iii) The reduction of costs corresponding to the variable remuneration attributed to members of Novo Banco's executive board for the financial years 2020 (for the amount of $€ 1,860$ thousand) and 2019 (for the amount of $€ 1,997$ thousand). This latter tranche had already justified a reduction of the payment made in 2020, but should continue to be adjusted, taking into account the functioning of the contingent capitalisation mechanism. The amount of the payment to Novo Banco determined by the resolution fund was therefore $€ 429,013$ thousand.

Payment made by the resolution fund required a budgetary amendment, which was authorised in a ruling issued by the minister of state and finance.

Authorisation for a tranche of $€ 112,000$ thousand of the amount of $€ 429,013$ thousand was made conditional on the completion of a further investigation, which included the need for an external opinion on Novo Banco's option not to implement a hedge accounting policy on derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on exposure to long term sovereign debt bonds. A payment of $€ 317,013$ thousand was therefore made to Novo Banco and the necessary steps will be taken to assess the existence of the condition governing the transfer of the amount of $€ 112,000$ thousand.

The payment to Novo Banco was fully financed by resources from a loan obtained from seven national credit institutions. The loan matures in 2046 and pays interest at the Portuguese Republic's financing cost for the period between the date upon which the contract was entered into (May 31, 2021) and December 31, 2026, plus a 15 basis points margin. The interest rate will be reviewed at December 31, 2026 and thereafter every five years, corresponding to the Portuguese Republic's five year financing cost, plus a 15 basis points margin.

Even considering the amount of $€ 429,013$ thousand (or up to the amount requested by Novo Banco), the amount determined for 2020 is less than the amount of the losses of $€ 752,000$ thousand recognised in the said year on the assets covered by the contingent capitalisation mechanism.

On the other hand, accrued losses on such assets (between June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2021 totals $€ 4,367,000$ thousand and even if the amount of $€ 429,013$ thousand for 2020 is taken into consideration the accrued amount of resolution fund payments will be $€ 3,405,000$ thousand, which is $€ 962,000$ thousand less than the accrued losses.

As in previous years, the contingent capitalisation mechanism limits the amount of the resolution fund's payments to the amount necessary for Novo Banco's capital ratios to remain at the agreed levels.

On February 13, 2023, the ministry of finance announced that the European Commission intended to declare the completion of Novo Banco's restructuring process, confirming the successful restructuring of Novo Banco, resulting from the combined implementation of the restructuring plan agreed in 2017, in the context of the sales operation conducted by Banco de Portugal and the sales agreements, in particular the contingent capitalisation agreement under which the amount transferred by the resolution fund to Novo Banco was $€ 485,000$ thousand less than the maximum amount of $€ 3,890,000$ thousand defined in the contract.

The completion of Novo Banco's restructuring operation in which the resolution fund has retained a 19.31\% stake is also another indicator that Novo Banco will not need to request any further payment from the resolution fund under the contingent capitalisation agreement, without prejudice to the ongoing or any future dispute regarding the amounts already requested by Novo Banco for past years and that the resolution fund considers are not due.

# Resolution measure on Banif - Banco Internacional do Funchal, S.A. 

According to the Bank of Portugal's announcement of December 20, 2015, a decision was made to sell off the activity of Banif - Banco Internacional do Funchal, S.A. (Banif) and most of its assets and liabilities to Banco Santander Totta for the amount of $€ 150,000$ thousand. According to the referred to announcement, the impositions of European institutions and the unfeasibility of the voluntary sale of Banif led to the disposal being made under the terms of a resolution measure.

Most of the unsold assets were transferred to Oitante, S.A. (Oitante) as an asset management vehicle which was specifically created for this purpose, with the resolution fund as its sole shareholder. Oitante, accordingly, issued debt bonds all of which were acquired by Banco Santander Totta, with a guarantee having been issued by the resolution fund and counter guaranteed by the Portuguese state.

The operation involved a state loan of around $€ 2,255,000$ thousand to cover future contingencies of which $€ 489,000$ thousand from the resolution fund and $€ 1,766,000$ thousand directly from the Portuguese state, as a result of the options for the delimitation of the disposal perimeter on assets and liabilities as agreed between the Portuguese authorities, European instances and Banco Santander Totta.

On July 21, 2016, the resolution fund made a payment of $€ 163,120$ thousand to the state in part early repayment of the resolution measures for Banif - Banco Internacional do Funchal, S.A. (Banif), enabling the debt to be reduced from $€ 489,000$ thousand to $€ 353,000$ thousand.

The amount not transferred to the single resolution fund will be paid by the institutions covered by the unique mechanism of resolution (UMR) regulation to the same single resolution fund across a period of eight years (ending 2024), as provided for in Council implementing resolution no. 2015/81 (EU) of December 19, 2014.

On March 21, 2017, the resolution fund announced an alteration of the conditions of the loans obtained to fund the Banif resolution measure, similar to those described for the funding of the BES resolution measure.

Notwithstanding, at the present time, in light of the above referred to developments:
(i) As the resolution fund is unlikely to propose the creation of a special contribution to finance the above referred to resolution measures, the probability of any special contribution is remote, and

(ii) Any resolution fund deficits are expected to be financed by periodic contributions under article 9 of decree law 24/2013 of February 19, which stipulates that periodic contributions to the resolution fund should be paid by participating institutions that are active on the last day of the month of April of the year to which the periodic contribution refers. Such contributions, in addition to the banking sector contribution, are recognised in costs for the period under IFRIC 21 - "Levies".

Any alterations on a level of the application of the resolution fund's above referred to financing mechanisms may have relevant impacts on CGD's future financial statements.

On June 29, 2012, CGD issued €900,000 thousand in hybrid financial instruments eligible as core tier 1 own funds, fully subscribed for by the Portuguese state (as defined in ministerial ruling 8840-C/2012 of June 28, 2012). These bonds were convertible into shares in the following circumstances:

- CGD's full or part cancellation or suspension of the payment of interest on the hybrid financial instruments;
- A materially relevant breach of the recapitalisation plan;
- CGD's failure to repurchase the full amount of the hybrid financial instruments up to the term of the investment period of five years;
- Exercising of the conversion right specified by the state in the issuance conditions; and
- If the hybrid financial instruments cease to be eligible as core tier 1 own funds.

Following authorisation from the European Central Bank and the Bank of Portugal on December 6, 2016, obtained under the new recapitalisation process negotiated with the European authorities, Caixa received the hybrid financial instruments eligible as core tier 1 own funds (CoCo bonds), as a capital increase in kind plus their corresponding accrued and unpaid interest up to January 4, 2017 as the date of the capital increase.

Following this process, the European Commission also lifted the interdiction in force on the payment of discretionary coupons on subordinated debt. CGD resumed payment of the respective coupons in first quarter 2017.

CGD completed the last stage of the recapitalisation procedure agreed with the European institutions in 2018, through its issuance of $€ 500,000$ thousand in tier 2 subordinated debt.

# 27. Capital and other instruments 

CGD's share capital, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was fully owned by the Portuguese state, as follows (in euros):

|  | $31-12-2022$ | $31-12-2021$ |
| :-- | --: | --: |
| Number of shares | $768,828,747$ | $768,828,747$ |
| Unit price (Euros) | 5 | 5 |
| Share capital | $3,844,143,735$ | $3,844,143,735$ |

The Portuguese state, under the March 2017 agreement with the European authorities as part of CGD's recapitalisation process, on January 4, 2017, decided to perform the following operations:
(i) An increase in CGD's share capital to $€ 7,344,144$ thousand, comprising the issuance of $288,828,747$ ordinary shares with a nominal value of $€ 5$ each through the transfer in kind of 490,000,000 Parcaixa, SGPS, S.A. equity shares for the amount of $€ 498,996$ thousand and transfer in kind of $€ 900,000$ thousand in CoCo bonds (note 23), plus $€ 45,148$ thousand in respective accrued interest; and
(ii) A $€ 6,000,000$ thousand reduction of CGD's share capital through the extinguishing of $1,200,000,000$ shares to cover negative retained earnings of $€ 1,404,506$ thousand and to set up free reserves for the amount of $€ 4,595,494$ thousand.

Latterly, on March 30, 2017, the state issued a resolution undertaking a new capital increase of $€ 2,500,000$ thousand, through the issuance of 500,000,000 new ordinary shares with a nominal value of $€ 5$ each, fully subscribed for by the sole shareholder.

CGD issued €500,000 thousand in additional tier 1 shares, fully subscribed for by corporate professional investors on the same date. Interest of $10.75 \%$ is paid on this issuance.

On February 1, 2022, Caixa was authorised by the European Central Bank to make early repayment of its issuance of additional tier 1 capital for the amount of $€ 500,000$ thousand, effective March 30, 2022.

The authorisation for early repayment derives from the ECB's positive assessment of Caixa's financial strength, reflecting the successful completion of its difficult, demanding restructuring plan.

# 28. Reserves, retained earnings and profit attributable to CGD's shareholder 

Reserves and retained earnings, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, were as follows:

|  | $31-12-2022$ | $31-12-2021$ |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Revaluation reserves |  |  |
| Legal revaluation reserve of fixed assets | 110,425 | 110,425 |
| Fair value reserve, net of deferred tax |  |  |
| Financial assets at fair value trough other comprehensive income (Note 8) | 16,133 | 143,034 |
| Assets with repurchase agreement | 137 | - |
| Other revaluation reserves | 2,967 | 1,619 |
|  | 129,663 | 255,079 |
| Other reserves and retained earnings |  |  |
| Legal reserve - CGD | 394,505 | 306,198 |
| Special reserve associated with the special regime applicable to deferred tax assets (Note 19) | 681,571 | 681,571 |
| Other reserves | $5,112,569$ | $4,656,890$ |
| Retained earnings | $(1,822,740)$ | $(1,778,086)$ |
|  | $4,365,905$ | $3,866,572$ |
| Net income attributable to the shareholder of CGD | 842,786 | 583,361 |
|  | $5,338,354$ | $4,705,012$ |

As referred to in greater detail in note 19, as a consequence of the negative net income from CGD's separate activity in 2016 and as defined by law 61/2014, the procedures for the conversion of deferred tax assets into tax credit, for a final amount of $€ 420,575$ thousand were completed in 2019. Under the applicable legislation, the conversion of deferred tax assets was preceded by the creation of a special reserve of $€ 681,571$ thousand plus $10 \%$, for the amount of the tax credit calculated in the conversion process, adjusted to meet the requirements of no. 3 of article 11 of law 61/2014. The creation of the special reserve was accompanied by the issuance and simultaneous attribution of an equivalent amount of conversion rights to the state.

The special reserve is recognised in "Other reserves".
The "Fair value reserve" recognises unrealised capital gains and losses on debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.

The currency translation reserve, which recognises the translation of subsidiaries' financial statements in foreign currency, is included in "Other reserves".

The legal revaluation reserves for fixed assets may only be used to cover accrued losses or increase capital. CGD's non-distributable reserves of $€ 110,425$ thousand were, accordingly, set up in compliance with the following legislation:

| Tangible fixed assets |  |
| :--: | :--: |
| Decree-Law no. 219/82, of June 2 | 1,752 |

# Appropriation of profit for the period 

## Financial year 2021

A resolution was passed at the general meeting of shareholders held on May 31, 2022, to appropriate 20\% of net profit to the legal reserve ( $€ 88,307$ thousand), incorporate $€ 112,156$ thousand in the "Other reserves and retained earnings" account and make a dividend payment of $€ 241,071$ thousand following the respective approval of the competent supervisory authorities under the terms of European and national legislation in force. Considering that Caixa also enjoys a robust financial situation and that the alteration of the amount to be paid to its shareholder does not prejudice its capacity to comply with legal and regulatory, namely prudential, requirements, including MREL (minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities) and also considering the communications with the supervisors on this matter, a decision was also made to pay an additional amount of $€ 137,160$ thousand, under the same terms and conditions as set out in the resolution of November 29, 2021.

Caixa therefore paid its shareholder an amount of $€ 378,231$ thousand in 2022.
Financial year 2020
A resolution was passed at the general meeting of shareholders of May 31, 2021, to appropriate 20\% of net profit to the legal reserve ( $€ 81,308$ thousand), incorporate $€ 241,592$ thousand in the "Other reserves and retained earnings" account and make a dividend payment of $€ 83,639$ thousand, after obtaining the respective approval of the competent supervisory authorities under European and national legislation in force.

Under the terms of its sole shareholder's unanimously approved corporate resolution set out in writing of November 29, 2021, the Portuguese state decided to pay an extraordinary dividend of $€ 300,000$ thousand, which was settled in November 2021. This resolution was based on the ECB's recommendations on the distribution of dividends during the pandemic and the lifting, in July 2021, of restrictions on their distribution after September 2021, normalisation of economic activity and financial markets and the October 2021 resolutions of CGD's management and supervisory bodies in favour of such a dividend distribution, pursuant to which Caixa paid its shareholder a total amount of $€ 383,639$ thousand in 2021.

The increase in "Income from non-financial assets - Other tangible assets", in 2022, is explained by the capital gains of $€ 35,902$ thousand on France branch's sale of its headquarters building in Rue de Provence.

The increase in "Income from non-financial assets - Investment properties" in 2022 derives from the capital gains of $€ 25,118$ thousand on the disposal of a Fundolis fund properly.

The increase in "Other Operating Income - Other" recorded in 2022, derives from the effect of the recoverability of IRC taxable income for 1994 and 1995 of the former BNU, with an impact of €34,278 thousand.

The resolution fund, created by decree law 31-A/2012 of February 10, introduced a resolution regime under the general credit institutions and financial corporations regime, approved by decree law 298/92 of December 31.

The measures provided for in the resolution regime have been designed, as appropriate, to recover or prepare the orderly liquidation of credit institutions and certain investment companies in financial distress. They comprise three Bank of Portugal intervention stages in the form of corrective intervention, provisional administration and resolution.

The resolution fund's principal mission, herein, is therefore to provide financial support to the implementation of the resolution mechanisms adopted by the Bank of Portugal.

The transposition of the bank recovery and resolution directive (directive 2014/59/EU) into national legislation introduced a common European Union resolution regime providing for losses on the bankruptcy processes of banking institutions to be borne by their shareholders and creditors. It will be financed by mandatory contributions to the single resolution fund.

At the end of 2021, the human resources adjustment programme, created under CGD's restructuring plan based on retirements, early retirements and voluntary redundancies, applicable to the group's domestic perimeter was renewed for the period 2022 to 2024.

Pursuant to the above, CGD recognised a global amount of $€ 46,546$ thousand, in employee costs for the period ended December 31, 2022. Of this amount, $€ 36,251$ thousand was associated with the provision for early retirements and voluntary redundancies, with the remainder comprising the recognition of an increase of $€ 10,295$ thousand in the "Retirements prior to the standard retirement age" aggregate of the "Pension liabilities" component. A net cost of $€ 2,044$ thousand was also recognised in employee costs as a result of the combination between the costs of voluntary redundancies (around $€ 4,353$ thousand) and gains of around $€ 2,309$ thousand associated with this agreement.

The average number of employees in CGD and its subsidiaries, for the periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 by type of function, was as follows:

|  | 31-12-2022 | 31-12-2021 |

The average number of employees at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 does not include employees of the Caixa Geral de Aposentações support department (237 and 249 respectively), employees assigned to CGD's social services (37 and 42, respectively) and employees in other situations i.e. secondments or extended absences ( 151 and 164 respectively).

The number of permanent staff at the end of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 does not include employees in the Caixa Geral de Aposentações support department (230 and 246 respectively), employees assigned to CGD's social services (36 and 37, respectively) and employees in other situations i.e. secondments or extended absences ( 156 and 150 respectively).

# 36. Retirement pensions and other employee benefits 

## Retirement pensions and post-retirement death Grant

## Liabilities to CGD employees

Under article 39 of decree law 48.953 of April 5, 1969 and decree law 161/92 of 1 August, CGD is responsible for the payment of employees' retirement pensions for sickness, disability or old age and the survivors' pensions of employees taken on after January 1, 1992. Caixa Geral de Aposentações ("CGA") is responsible for the survivors' pensions of employees taken on prior to January 1, 1992. These employees discount 2.5\% of their remuneration to CGA, for the purpose in question.

In conformity with the vertical collective wage bargaining negotiations in force in the banking sector, the former BNU had also undertaken to make cash payments to its employees for their early retirement and old age, disability and survivors' pensions. These payments comprised a percentage increasing in line with the number of years' service, applied to the wage scales negotiated annually with banking employees' unions. Pension liabilities for BNU employees were transferred to CGD in 2001, following BNU's incorporation into CGD. Former BNU employees, still working at the date of the merger, were therefore covered by the pension and benefits plan in force in CGD. The pension plan in force at the date of the respective retirements continued to be applied to BNU retirees and pensioners on the merger date.

With reference to November 30, 2004, all liabilities for the retirement pensions of CGD employees were transferred to CGA in respect of their length of service up to December 31, 2000 under decree laws 240A/2004 of December 29 and 241-A/2004 of December 30. The transfer included liability for the death grant after the standard retirement age for the above referred to length of service.

The Portuguese government published decree law 14/2023 on February 24, 2023. Effective December 31, 2022, it transfers the remaining liabilities covered by CGD's pension fund (FPCGD) to Caixa Geral de Aposentações and extinguishes the FPCGD. Caixa paid financial compensation to CGA for the transferred liabilities.

Unless expressly stated, the information disclosed in this note for December 31, 2022 is based on an actuarial assessment carried out from a viewpoint of the continuity of CGD's pension fund as a going concern.

CGD's pension liabilities, at December 31, 2022, therefore comprised the following:

1. Liabilities for the services of working employees, after December 31, 2000;
2. Part share of liabilities for the length of service provided in the said period, for employees retiring between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2022;
3. Liabilities for the retirement and respective survivors' pensions of BNU employees already being paid at the date of the merger; and
4. Liabilities for death grants for the length of service provided after December 31, 2000.

Pension payments are based on employees' length of service and respective remuneration upon their retirement date and are reviewed on the basis of the remuneration in force for working employees.

CGD's pension plan is not applicable to working employees taken on after January 1, 2006, as following the closure of the Caixa Geral de Aposentações regime to new members from the said date, workers hired by CGD after the said date have already been obligatorily enrolled in the general social security regime.

CGD makes the contributions necessary to cover its pensions liabilities, for which it set up a pension fund in December 1991. According to the regime applicable to CGD, its employees pay the following percentages of their remuneration into the pension fund:

- Employees hired before January 1, 1992
$7,5 \%$
- Employees hired after January 1, 1992
$11,0 \%$
The full amount of the latters' contribution is paid into the pension fund given that it is responsible for the respective survivors' pensions regime.

The liability for defined benefit plans recognised in the balance sheet comprises the difference between the present value of liabilities and fair value of pension funds' assets. Total liabilities are calculated annually by specialised actuaries, using the unit credit projected method and adequate actuarial assumptions. The rate used for liabilities discounting purposes is based on market interest rates on investment grade corporate bonds denominated in the currencies in which the liabilities are paid and with similar periods to maturity to the average settlement period of the liabilities, in line with the provisions of IAS 19.

Profit and loss on differences between the actuarial and financial assumptions used and the effective amounts of liabilities as regards the pension fund's expected yield, in addition to the results of alterations of actuarial assumptions are recognised directly in a shareholders' equity account.

The annual cost of retirement and survivors' pensions, including current servicing and interest costs, net of the expected yield of the fund's assets and employees' contributions, comprises the net amount of the "Employee costs" account.

The impact of employees' early retirements, as defined in the actuarial study, is recognised directly in "Employee costs".

# Determination of liabilities for retirement pensions and post-retirement death grants. 

Actuarial studies to determine liabilities for the current payment of retirement pensions and past services of working employees, at December 31, 2022 (with the pension funds as a going concern) and December 31, 2021, have been carried out by an independent. specialised entity.

The following hypotheses and technical bases were used:

|  | 31-12-2022 | 31-12-2021 |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Actuarial method | Projected Unit Credit | Projected Unit Credit |
| Mortality table |  |  |

| Women | TV 99/01 (-2 years) | TV 88/90 (-3 years) |
| Disability table | EKV 80 | EKV 80 |
| Discount rate | $3,600 \%$ | $1,350 \%$ |
| Salary growth rate | $4.4 \%$ until 2023 and $1.4 \%$ after | $0.60 \%$ from 2022 |
| Pension growth rate | $3.9 \%$ until 2023 and $1.0 \%$ after | $0.30 \%$ from 2022 |
| Retirement age | 36 years of service with at least 60 years of age, with a maximum of 70 years of age. There is also the possibility of retirement at 59 years of age with 39 years of service or 58 years of age with 42 years of service. | 36 years of service with at least 60 years of age, with a maximum of 70 years of age. There is also the possibility of retirement at 59 years of age with 39 years of service or 58 years of age with 42 years of service. |

As defined under IAS 19 - "Employee benefits", the discount rate is determined on the basis of market rates on low risk bonds, with a similar maturity to Caixa's liabilities (15 years). In 2022, in view of the significant alterations in the main market benchmarks for fixing the discount rate between December 2021 and December 2022, CGD opted to increase its discount rate from $1.35 \%$ to $3.60 \%$ from a viewpoint of the pension fund's continuity, owing to the interest rate movements in international markets, namely those which determine the diverse reference rates calculated for updating actuarial liabilities.

Following a long period of falling interest rates in international markets, in particular risk-free issuers, a phenomenon of rate increases was observed across second half 2021. This was very pronounced across 2022, owing to a macroeconomic inflationary environment. The constraints on economic activity and global trade deriving from the pandemic were heightened by the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and reflected in a significant, across-the-board growth of international commodity prices.

In addition to the evolution of the military conflict in Ukraine reference should also be made to the way in which markets are reacting to the fiscal policies of the main European economies and the monetary policies

of central banks have led to a relevant increase in the volatility of short term reference rates. CGD has accordingly set a lower discount rate than the main benchmarks, as a mitigating factor of the environmental effects noted in the market.

The assumptions regarding wage and pension growth rates were also revised upwards, especially for 2023, as a result of the already referred to constraints on economic activity in 2022 and their impact on the Portuguese economy, in fuelling uncertainty and higher inflation rates, particularly in the energy and food components.

CGD considers that it is possible to maintain the wage growth rate over the long term, i.e. at $0.9 \%$, after 2024, as a threshold used in the June 2022 actuarial calculation that was in line with the most conservative assumption used in the market on the said date.

However, in view of the uncertain scenario and the conservative approach that has characterised CGD's policy in this regard, it was decided to incorporate a 50 bps margin in the referred to wage growth rate to accommodate the risk of future deviations, using, an assumed wage growth rate of $4.4 \%$ for 2023 and $1.4 \%$ for the following years.

Using the same approach regarding the assumption for the pensions growth rate, i.e. incorporating a 50 bps margin to accommodate any risk of deviations - a rate of $3.9 \%$ was set for 2023 and $1 \%$ for the following years.

As opposed to the trend observed across the period 2020 to 2022, greatly affected by the pandemic and whose future effects are still to be determined, in terms of mortality rates, CGD also continued to adopt a conservative approach to its calculation of post-employment benefits, by altering mortality tables in June 2022 to reflect an increase in average life expectancy compared to the previous rates.

A comparison between the actuarial and financial assumptions used to assess CGD's pension costs, for 2022 and 2021 and effective amounts is set out in the following table:

|  | 31-12-2022 |  | 31-12-2021 |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |

| Pension growth rate | $3.900 \%$ | $1.480 \%$ | $0.300 \%$ | $0.350 \%$ |

At December 31, 2022 (with the pension fund as a going concern) and December 31, 2021, liabilities for past services according to the actuarial studies, in addition to the funds available to cover them, amounted to:

The Bank of Portugal's notice 4/2005 of February 28, sets out an obligation to fully finance liabilities for retirees and early retirees with a minimum financing level of $95 \%$ for liabilities for the past services of working employees.

At December 31, 2022, according to the fund manager's calculations, the fund was worth $€ 3,306,871$ thousand. This amount was sufficient to cover the minimum mandatory funding required by the current regulations applicable to this category of liabilities, i.e. the need to cover $100 \%$ of liabilities for retirees and at least $95 \%$ for working employees. At the end of 2022, the financial coverage of liabilities for the plan and pensions was around $119 \%$.

CGD employees' pension fund rented out buildings to Caixa for the amount of $€ 322,271$ thousand and $€ 330,439$ thousand, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively in addition to holding

securities, issued by Caixa and investment units in property funds managed by CGD group companies for the amount of $€ 344,202$ thousand and $€ 372,715$ thousand, respectively.

CGD employees' pension fund had deposits of $€ 154,499$ thousand and $€ 290,052$ thousand with Caixa Geral de Depósitos, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

The fund's assets are subject to interest rate, credit, equity market, property market, liquidity and foreign exchange risk.

The fund's investment policy involves exposure to the equities, bonds and property market in addition to alternative investments such as private equity and infrastructure funds.

The fund's investment policy aims to mitigate a part of interest rate and inflation risks. This protection comprises the allocation of investments to long term, variable-rate bonds as part protection from oscillations in the financial market's yield curve over the long term.

The fund may use futures and options on share indices and forward exchange rates to mitigate market and foreign exchange risks.

The economic environment over the last few years, allied to the scarcity of alternative, longer term maturity investments, has not made it possible to match the different asset categories to the average maturity of liabilities, based on an asset liability matching (ALM) approach.

Information on the change in spread between liabilities for past services and the pension fund in addition to its corresponding impact in the financial statements, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 is given below:

Liabilities deviations, on a CGD level, in 2022 and 2021, were as follows:

|  | 31-12-2022 | 31-12-2021 |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Change in the salary growth rate | $(155,530)$ | - |

| Other actuarial gains and losses | $(123,355)$ | $(3,987)$ |
|  | 578,208 | 179,232 |

The occurrence of a liabilities deviation in December 2022, for an overall amount of around $€ 578,000$ thousand is mainly explained by the positive impact of the alteration of the discount rate ( $1.35 \%$ to $3.60 \%$ ) as opposed to the negative impacts of the alteration of wage and pension growth rates and alteration of mortality tables.

CGD Portugal's social services are responsible for the medical care services for its working employees and pensioners. Based on the new agreement between CGD and its social services (SS CGD) on April 30, 2021, there was a change in CGD's contributions to its social services from a fixed rate of $6.5 \%$ to a different fixed monthly amount depending on a subscriber's status (working, retired and other beneficiaries). CGD is also responsible for making contributions to its medical care services (SAMS) for former BNU employees, retiring up to July 23, 2001.

Medical-social care liabilities for past services were assessed on the basis of actuarial studies by specialised entities, using identical actuarial assumptions to those for the above referred to pension liabilities.

Liabilities for past services are recognised in "Provisions" (note 24). The respective movements for 2022 and 2021 were:

| Liabilities at December 31, 2020 | 524,845 |
| :-- | --: |

| Actuarial gains (Note 24) | $(36,157)$ |
| Liabilities at December 31, 2022 | 309,231 |

# Other long term benefits 

Beginning March 2020, CGD, as part of the alterations to the company agreement, replaced the seniority bonus by a career bonus, payable to each employee on the date of his/her retirement and comprising up to $1.5^{\prime \prime}$ times the amount of their remuneration. The liability of $€ 8,167$ thousand to meet this commitment at December 31, 2022 was recognised in "Other liabilities" (note 26).

Caixa pays a death grant for its working employees prior to the standard retirement age.
France branch also pays long term benefits to employees. Liabilities of $€ 14,724$ thousand and $€ 15,427$ thousand were assessed, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

CGD recognises a specific liability for the impact of the change to "non-working" status of employees with whom it has entered into redundancy agreements. CGD set up a provision for its early retirement programme in 2017 to cover the three year period 2018-2020, as an extension to the early retirement programme set up in 2017 to facilitate the exits of CGD and CGD group employees who, not being eligible for voluntary retirement, were interested in the possibility of early retirement. CGD extended the early retirement programme for an additional 3 years (2022 to 2024) in December 2021.

The respective liability recognised by CGD, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 amounted to $€ 220,201$ thousand and $€ 275,732$ thousand, respectively and is recognised in "Provisions" (note 24):

Transfer of the current liabilities of CGD's pension fund to Caixa Geral de Aposentações (CGA)
In conformity with its preliminary note of February 24, 2023, the Portuguese government published decree law 14/2023, transferring all liabilities covered by CGD's pension fund (FPCGD) to CGA, including the extinguishing and liquidation of the FPCGD and Caixa's payment to CGA of financial compensation for the transferred liabilities.

This operation was based on a conservative scenario with the technical support of the legal framework and actuarial studies carried out by an independent actuary, validated by the insurance and pension funds authority (ASF).

Whereas all of Caixa's current and potential liabilities for which the fund is responsible will be transferred to CGA, including liabilities for pensions and current payments thereof in addition to new pensions and payments, the pension fund will be liquidated in accordance with the above referred to decree law, effective December 31, 2022.

Under the terms of IAS 19, CGD has already recognised the premium paid on the transaction, comprising the difference between the liabilities calculated on a going concern basis - $€ 2,772,568$ thousand (at a discount rate of $3.6 \%$ ) and the amount defined in the operation - $€ 3,018,340$ thousand (at a discount rate of $3.2 \%$ ), calculated on the basis of a settlement scenario in employee costs in its profit and loss statement for 2022, having accordingly recognised a cost of $€ 245,772$ thousand in 2022 (gross, for a net impact of around $€ 178,554$ thousand).

It should also be noted that, following the formal approval process of this legal statute, CGD took the necessary steps to dispose of most of the fund's assets, including risk assets. On February 24, as the date upon which the decree law was promulgated, a considerable reduction in exposure to all asset classes, except for real estate, had already been achieved, as follows:

| Asset Class <br> (24-02-2023) | Fund Allocation |  |  | Change in: <br> 31-12-2022 |  |
| :-- | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
|  | 31-12-2022 | 31-01-2023 | 24-02-2023 | 31-01-2023 | 24-02-2023 |
| Equity | 784,727 | 837,347 | 5,481 | 52,620 | $(779,246)$ |
| Bonds | $1,610,220$ | $1,626,503$ | 350,484 | 16,284 | $(1,259,736)$ |
| Real Estate | 621,551 | 620,896 | 621,061 | $(655)$ | $(490)$ |
| Alternative Inv. | 78,157 | 78,256 | 78,119 | 99 | $(38)$ |
| Money Market | 212,217 | 216,772 | $2,333,854$ | 4,555 | $2,121,637$ |
| Total | $3,306,871$ | $3,379,775$ | $3,388,998$ | 72,904 | 82,127 |

This operation entails an immediate cost for Caixa but eliminates the future actuarial risks associated with the pension fund.

Caixa's only risk up until the end of 2027 is associated with a CGA compensation mechanism for any deviations between the wage and pension growth rates used as assumptions in the operation and the effective rates. This compensation will be assessed in 2028 with data up to December 2027 subject to a maximum amount of $€ 320,000$ thousand.

According to IAS 37, Caixa's financial statements must recognise the contingent liability associated with this compensation mechanism. The assessment made in the context of the preparation of the financial statements for December 2022 has led to the conclusion that this mechanism has a zero value at this time, taking into account both Caixa's management capacity over the various remuneration components having an impact on the growth of the remuneration and pensions of beneficiaries as a whole, whose liabilities are being transferred to CGA and the degree of conservatism of the assumptions underlying the transfer:

- Wages - 4.4\% in 2023 and 1.4\% starting 2024 - compared to the assumption of $0.9 \%$ that CGD would use in a going concern scenario, taking historical data into account;
- Pensions - 3.9\% in 2023 and 1\% starting 2024 - compared to the assumption of $0.9 \%$ that CGD would use in a going concern scenario, taking historical data into account.

Caixa will assess the value of this contingent liability on a half-yearly basis as part of the preparation of its financial statements for disclosure purposes, recording a provision if a positive figure arises within the scope of that assessment.

Impairment on subsidiaries recognised as being held-for-sale at December 31, 2021 - BCG Brazil amounted to $€ 46,483$ thousand.

Impairment of $€ 42,837$ thousand on BCG Brazil had also been declared at December 31, 2021 for the purpose of adjusting the equity value of these subsidiaries' assets and liabilities to its estimated respective fair value, net of disposal costs (note 14) at the said date.

The Impairment for the amount of around $€ 24,125$ thousand was used in 2022 following the sale of 2 properties (note 14).

The fact that increases of impairment on loans and advances to customers in 2022, were less than reversals and cancellations, in conjunction with asset write-offs, resulted in a reduction of the amount of impairment from €2,314,429 thousand at December 31, 2021 to €2,254,541 thousand at December 31, 2022. Reference should, herein, be made to the portfolio's positive reaction and particularly the reduction of exposure classified in additional risk stages mainly on account of the completion of credit recovery processes (stage 3 reduction), the finalising of credit cure periods in the case of recovery processes implemented in previous years (stage 2 and stage 3 reductions) and early loan repayments by several customers (across-the-board to the various stages).

Total impairment was in line with impairment on loans and advances to customers with a reduction of the total impairment balance from €2,786,610 thousand at the end of 2021 to €2,679,355 thousand at December 31, 2022.

Credit disposals, in 2022, originated the use of $€ 61,128$ thousand in impairment (note 13).

# 43. Disclosures relating to financial instruments 

## Management policies on financial risks inherent to the group's activity

CGD operates a centralised risk management model embracing the assessment and control of all of the group's credit, market and liquidity risks, based on the principle of the separation of functions between commercial and risk areas.

## Credit risk

The credit risk attached to CGD's customer portfolio is overseen and controlled by the monitoring of indicators which are split up by type of product, customer segment, maturities, types of guarantee, level of exposure to the financial system, sector of activity and geography. The amount of large exposures vis-à-vis the maximum limits defined by supervisors is also analysed. CGD has implemented a system for the identification, assessment and control of risk on its credit portfolio, beginning at the time the loan is made and continually monitored across the lifetime of the operations.

CGD assesses the amount of impairment on each credit sub-portfolio on a monthly basis in its implementation of the international accounting standards by splitting them up into like-for-like risk segments and use of probabilities of default (PD) and migration to default and recoveries after default (loss given default - LGD) annually updated on the basis of historical information.

The credit portfolio was monitored by the credit risk division (DGR) which reviewed the credit oversight and recovery policy in addition to incorporating default and non-performing exposure concepts, in alignment with the definitions published by the European Banking Authority (EBA) as part of the operational system used for daily monitoring operations on the credit portfolio. This system incorporates a series of rules and functionalities designed to promptly recognise risk events and enable work to begin on a series of corrective actions designed to regularise and recover credit:
(i) All customers have an associated risk level which is updated daily;
(ii) Retail customers on which more serious risk levels are identified are automatically allocated to specialised recovery areas; and
(iii) The measures taken to regularise the loan are identified, enabling their level of efficiency to be assessed.

The process is monitored and sent by the risk management division in a monthly report.
As part of the lending process, the credit risks division, which has corporate functions and reports directly to the executive committee, is responsible for decision-making and/or credit analysis functions on corporates, financial institutions, institutionals and personal customers.

The analysis of lending to corporates, in addition to natural portfolio oversight, focuses on customer credit risk, respective economic group and proposed operations. Its functions are separate from those of the commercial area which is responsible for submitting the proposals containing the conditions attached to the operations.

The analysis is based on the ratings issued by rating agencies and internal assessment models in addition to quantitative and qualitative weighting factors on the customer/economic group and operation in question. The overall market environment and the economy in which the entities operate and any aspects/conditions which could mitigate credit risk are also taken into account.

## Market risk

Market risk management rules are defined for each portfolio or business unit at least once a year to ensure that the risk levels incurred on CGD group's credit portfolios are commensurate with its risk appetite. They include the relevant types of market risk, including concentration of exposure (by name, sector, rating and country), asset market liquidity indicators, composition of authorised assets and instruments and also define maximum acceptable loss levels.

Portfolio changes are subject to an exhaustive daily examination for the purpose of identifying changes in profile or any segments meriting special attention. The use of the defined limits is overseen by the risk management function on a daily basis and reported to the management bodies and officers responsible for the management of each portfolio.

Market risk hedging operations are decided by portfolio or business unit managers, based on the need to comply with market risk management rules in the form of authorised instruments and defined limits.

The most common market risk metric used for all types of market risk is value at risk (VaR) which is calculated for all types of market risk (interest rates (and spread), shares, exchange rates and volatility), based on the historical simulation method, whose confidence levels used in the simulation are contingent upon portfolio retention objectives. Additional metrics are also monitored on certain portfolios and include: Expected Shortfall and Third Worst. Other market risk measurements, such as sensitivity to the price changes of the underlying assets (basis point value - bpv, on interest rates) and other sensitivity indicators commonly used for share portfolios and usually referred to as "Greeks", are also used.

The reliability of the VaR (value at risk) model is monitored daily on the basis of a comparative analysis between value at risk and theoretical and real backtesting results. The number of exceptions obtained enables the model's accuracy to be assessed and the need for any necessary adjustments or calibrations. Backtesting operations also include hypotheses, excess and normality tests.

CGD group also performs regular stress tests on its market and foreign exchange risk at least once a month. Stress tests aim to measure the impact of adverse events on exposure to risk, based on their impact on the fair value of investments and the quantitative and qualitative suitability of CGD group's own funds. Stress tests are based on risk factor scenarios that, as a whole, represent situations that could originate extraordinary losses on portfolios subject to market risk. These factors specifically include events with a low possibility of occurrence associated with the principal types of risk, including various market and foreign exchange risk components. The scenarios used aim to identify the potential risk of extreme market conditions and the probabilities of occurrence not covered by VaR. Several of the scenarios accordingly aim to replicate the behaviour of financial variables to past events (i.e. crises) whereas others correspond to sensitivity analyses on one or more risk factors.

Executory functions on market operations and their associated risk control are completely separate.

# Foreign exchange risk 

Foreign exchange risk is controlled and assessed daily on an individual basis for domestic operations and for each of the branches and subsidiaries and monthly, on a consolidated level, for the group as a whole. VaR amounts and limits are calculated on total open and currency positions.

## Liquidity and balance sheet interest rate risk

Liquidity and balance sheet interest rate risk management policies are defined by the CALCO (Capital, Asset and Liability) committee. The risk management division's liquidity and balance sheet interest rate risk area measures, monitors and reports on the two types of risk.

The capital, assets and liabilities management board is the executive committee's decision-making arm responsible for the integrated assets and liabilities management process (ALM-asset liability management), which aims to achieve proactive balance sheet management and CGD group profitability. In the risk management domain, the ALM process normally focuses on liquidity and balance sheet interest rate risk, as a forum for the rapid dissemination of group-wide management information.

Liquidity risk management includes an analysis of the periods to maturity of different balance sheet assets and liabilities, evidencing cash inflow/outflow volumes for each bucket and respective liquidity gaps (spreads).

Liquidity risk management also includes stress tests based on an internally developed methodology articulated with the existing liquidity contingency plan, designed to assess the funding situation at any point of time, strengthening CGD's resistance to adverse shocks and examining funding alternatives.

CGD group has endeavoured to guarantee a sustainable resource-taking structure for its activity, across the year as a whole, based on the liquidity and period to maturity of its assets and off-balance-sheet exposures.

The methodology used to measure interest rate risk management includes a short term or accounting perspective and a long term or economic perspective.

The short term or accounting perspective for interest rate risk measurement purposes aims to estimate the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on interest margins. The methodology used for this purpose aggregates all assets and liabilities sensitive to interest rate changes into time bands, in accordance:
(i) with periods to maturity for fixed-rate financial instruments, and

(ii) with periods up to the repricing of interest rates for variable-rate financial instruments.

The respective interest rate gaps for these time bands are then calculated to approximate the effects of interest rate changes on net interest income.

Net interest income simulations are also used to improve the reliability of the estimates obtained from interest rate gaps on the sensitivity of interest margin. They include projections on the evolution of the group's balance sheet, integrating behaviours and trends of relevance to banking activity in addition to scenarios on the evolution of different market rates and expectations reflected in yield curves.

The long term or economic perspective on the assessment of interest rate risk aims to estimate the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on the economic value of capital. The methodology used for this purpose involves calculating the effective duration of assets and liabilities which are sensitive to changes in interest rates in addition to the respective duration gap, enabling the effect of interest rate changes to be matched to the economic value of capital.

Simulation techniques are also used to improve the reliability of the estimates obtained from the duration gap of the sensitivity of the economic value of capital. They include the assessment and respective estimation of all future cash flows on assets and liabilities sensitive to interest rate changes (i.e. full valuation).

Liquidity and balance sheet interest rate risks are based on a set of guidelines approved by the CALCO committee which includes the defining of limits on several significant exposure variables to such types of risk. The guidelines aim to ensure that CGD group is able to manage the return-risk trade-off for balance sheet management purposes and that it is also able to define a convenient exposure level and control the results of its risk policies and positions.

# Credit quality of loans and advances to credit institutions 

In terms of risk ratings on loans and advances to credit institutions, the counterparty rating is the lower of the ratings allocated by two of the international rating agencies, limited, in general terms, by the rating of the country in which the financial institution is headquartered and, this being the case, the rating of the financial group of which it is a member. In the case of financial institutions which do not have an external rating but which are mainly publicly owned, the rating used will be equivalent to the external rating allocated to the state in which the entity is headquartered.

The following ratings were used:

- Reduced risk ("AAA" - "BBB-" or investment grade);
- Average risk ("BB+" - "B-"); and,
- High risk ("CCC+" - "C").

The following table splits up the balance sheet amounts of loans and advances to credit institutions, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, considering the risk aggregating categories (reduced, average and high) associated with the external ratings and a counterparty's country of origin:

# Measurement criteria 

The sovereign debt issuances of the peripheral eurozone countries considered in the above table were measured at observable market prices, when applicable, or, in the absence of an active market, prices supplied by external counterparties. These portfolios were segmented into levels 1 and 2 of the fair value ranking at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Greater detail on the distinguishing elements of these categories together with their principal assumptions are provided in the "Fair value" column.

## Credit riskde

## Qualitative

1. Credit risk management policy

### 1.1 Credit risk management

In its response to diverse legal and regulatory requirements and with the objective of using best credit risk management practice, Caixa Geral de Depósitos has implemented a credit risk management process based on an organisational structure guaranteeing that the commercial (risk acceptance), recovery, decisionmaking and risk areas are independent from each other.

### 1.1.1 Issuance of loans

Lending activity is aligned with the credit risk management strategy and policies defined by the competent CGD bodies.

CGD has defined a centralised decision-making model on credit in which its credit risk division is responsible for making decisions on loans to corporates, financial institutions and institutionals in addition to personal customers. The governance model for the decisions to issue loans, including the limits on the delegating of authority have been defined in internal regulations.

The credit risk management division's main functions also include:

(i) The prior, mandatory issuance of a risk opinion on the attribution of internal limits or consideration of operations not covered by the said limits on customers whose exposure (in terms of economic groups), rating or specific characteristics of the operation (or its proponent), so justifies (in accordance with internal regulations);
(ii) A redefinition of credit limits to be submitted to a more senior level whenever deemed advisable under the circumstances; and
(iii) The approval of the constitution/alteration of economic groups.

Credit decisions on the most relevant exposures are the responsibility of the board of directors, credit risks executive committee or credit board, depending upon the amounts involved in the exposure in question. Other operations are the responsibility of credit risk committees on a credit risk division level.

The submission of operations/limits for a decision of the board of directors requires the advance approval of the financial risks committee.

The risk management division is involved in the credit risk control and monitoring process, lending stages and latter oversight, on both a customer/operation and a credit portfolio approach based on:
(i) The definition, development and maintenance of internal rating and scoring models;
(ii) The monitoring and global control of CGD group's credit risk by credit portfolios, products and subsidiaries;
(iii) The identification of customers at greater risk of default based on early warning signs;
(iv) The assessment and validation of individual impairment;
(v) A Determination of the expected credit loss (collective impairment) on all credit portfolio segments;
(vi) Assessment of compliance with the limits defined for major risks.

The risk management division may also submit the approval and review of the group's credit risk management policies and guidelines to a more senior level.

# 1.1.2 Credit portfolio oversight 

Credit portfolio oversight permits the early identification of signs of potential default, facilitating decisions for debt recovery optimisation purposes. The oversight process is regulated by an internal "credit oversight and recovery policy regulation".

CGD has implemented a workflow process across commercial, recovery and credit risk areas. The workflow classifies a customer's creditworthiness daily on the basis of pre-defined events and the level of severity of the probability of a default situation, automatically identifying customers in financial distress and in default.

All portfolio customers are segmented into one of the following categories:

- Performing customers without any additional risk events having been identified;
- Performing customers with early warnings which may indicate a greater probability of default;
- Customers registering serious events and a high probability of default who are classified as being in financial distress;
- Customers in a 24 months' probation period following the occurrence of a restructuring operation owing to its financial difficulties;
- Customers classified as being in default; and
- Customers classified as being in quarantine following actions taken to remedy default situations.

The workflow process incorporates operational measures which vary in line with the severity of the event and which provide the first line of defence based on mechanisms designed to actively prevent potential future defaults.

An automatic process immediately transfers customers from commercial to recovery areas whenever more serious events have been identified, to ensure that potentially more problematic cases are handled by specialised credit recovery managers.

When these more serious events involve corporate customers with relevant exposures, the decision to maintain customer management in commercial structures or to transfer them to specialised recovery areas is the responsibility of the credit risks executive committee and credit board, depending on an analysis of the level of liabilities of the customers in question, based on a specific report produced by the risk management division.

The credit risk management division diagnoses the process as a whole as part of the credit portfolio oversight process and makes any necessary changes in line with its analysis of metrics and indicators, set out in monthly monitoring reports on credit portfolio quality which are examined monthly by the executive committee and quarterly by the risk committee.

# 1.1.3 Credit recovery 

As soon as any arrears of payment have been noted, adequate steps are taken to recover the overdue credit to enable a settlement of the situation, in due compliance with the provisions of decree law 227/2012 (action plan for the risk of default ("PARI)"and extrajudicial procedures for the settlement of situations of default "PERSI") for loans and advances to personal customers. CGD's process was reviewed at the end of 2022 to respond to Decree-Law no. 80-A/2022.

Credit recovery consists of a series of CGD group actions on arrears of payment of one or more instalments of a credit operation. It is a fundamental function of CGD group's credit management and is implemented at the time of the first overdue payment of an instalment and across the whole of the rest of the loan's lifetime up to settlement.

Negotiated credit recoveries comprise three types of action by order of priority in terms of their application:

- Collection of payments in arrears;
- Restructuring solutions; and
- Terminal solutions not involving litigation.

Contacts with customers with a view to the settlement of overdue amounts at the initial credit collection phase are made by the call centre and the commercial area. If the initial contacts are not successful and the customer is in arrears for more than 30 days, the case is re-allocated to a recovery area with the objective of finding the most appropriate credit recovery solution.

In cases in which the negotiating process with a customer is not producing the desired effect for CGD group and its customers, credit recovery should move on to the litigation stage. This solution consists of the executing of assets or rights either mortgaged or pledged as loan collateral for the purpose of their judicial sale.

As an alternative recovery measure, CGD group also considers the disposal of credit portfolios or individual loans whenever this is considered to be the most efficient solution, following a due cost/benefit appraisal.

### 1.2 Concentration risk management

Credit concentration risk management within CGD group is the responsibility of its risk management division which identifies, measures and controls significant exposures.

Risk appetite statement metrics have been developed to monitor concentration risk. They permit the evolution of portfolio segments considered more critical in terms of credit risk to be controlled on a monthly basis.

Decisions to enter into agreements for operations entailing materially relevant exposures (as defined in an internal regulation) require the opinion of the credit risk division. The limit naturally considers the amount of CGD group's total exposure to a relevant customer and/or group of customers.

## 2. Loan write-off policy

The decision to write-off an asset, based on the write-off policy, as set out in an internal regulation, is made at a senior level when expectations of credit recovery are nil or highly residual and when all of the negotiating and, when applicable, legal proceedings have been taken with all of the parties involved in a loan agreement. Loans eligible for write-offs, when implying the full recognition of provisions and impairment, also include:

- Loans in arrears for more than 24 months; and

- Loans without a real guarantee.

3. Impairment reversal policy

The quantification of impairment losses is conditioned by the identification of events which indicate the deterioration of a counterparty's creditworthiness when having an impact on a loan's future cash flows.

In situations involving the occurrence of significant improvements in a debtor's creditworthiness and/or an adequate strengthening of real guarantees, the previously recognised loss is reduced to the level of the new calculated loss with a direct reversal of impairment.

Impairment is also reversed when loans are sold for a higher amount than their net impairment exposure.
4. Description of the implementation of restructuring measures and respective associated risks, in addition to their respective control and monitoring mechanisms

A credit restructuring operation is understood to be any changes to the conditions in force on credit operations involving loans and advances to customers in financial distress when resulting in any modification of the parties' rights or duties.

Specialised oversight and recovery areas endeavour to apply the best solutions to protect CGD group and its customers' interests in any given situation, pursuant to the terms of the delegated decision and limits defined in internal regulations.

Recovery solutions always bear a customer's individual circumstances and CGD's best interests in mind, in line with three basic principles:
(i) Impact on capital and cash flows. The first aspect to be considered is the referred to process's impact on CGD group's invested capital and cash flows generated by the operation in the future. This impact should be measured by calculating the incremental NPV on processing the operation as opposed to a solution involving litigation (considered to be a last recourse in terms of credit recovery);
(ii) Impact on customer. Secondly, the impact of the processing solution on the customer should be considered, based on two fundamental criteria:

- Payment capacity: The customer must to be able to meet its financial commitments in the new scenario, based on its expected income; and
- Sustainability of process: The process must be sustainable over time, i.e. the customer, with a high level of probability, must be able to make all necessary payments and should not relapse into a default situation.
(iii) Impact of complexity: The processing strategy should, lastly, consider several factors which may add to the complexity of default situations, with a different treatment from the one proposed, solely taking the former two principles into account. Even if the financial impact of the solution may not be optimal, other parameters such as a customer's specific characteristics, the impact of its treatment on CGD group's public image, reputational risk or a customer's willingness to negotiate are also part of the decision-making rules on the respective treatment.

Most credit which has been restructured owing to a customer's financial difficulties is subject to a specific impairment calculation process, across the whole of the minimum surveillance period of 24 months as defined in Commission implementing regulation (EU) no. 2021/451 of December 17, 2020.
5. Description of collateral valuation and management process

Immovable assets
The following types of immovable assets are considered for valuation purposes:
(i) Constructions:

- Finished constructions; and
- Unfinished constructions.
(ii) Land:

- Land with construction potential (as its prime and best use taking its construction potential into account); and
- Land without construction potential as its prime and best use.

The principal components of the valuation methodology on immovable assets in CGD group are:
(i) Inspection of property: Property is inspected when all new mortgage lending operations are entered into, with the objective of determining its presumed transaction price in a free market.

Certification of the value of an item of property is documented and includes, inter alia, copies of the plans, property registration booklet and description in the land registry, when supplied. These valuations are complemented by individual, direct in situ observations
(ii) An updated valuation of the property's worth by an appraiser: Mortgage lending operations whose contractual terms have been changed usually require a new valuation as if they were new operations.

In the case of non-performing credit, the amounts of real guarantees are examined and/or reviewed in line with the frequency defined in internal regulations; and;
(iii) Updated indexed amount: A review of property prices whenever there is sufficient data enabling a measurement to be made by this method by an internal CMVM-registered property appraiser. This methodology is used for residential or commercial properties, non-performing credit with a debtor balance of less than $€ 300$ thousand and, in the case of performing credit, a debtor balance of less than $€ 500$ thousand.

Valuation procedures for immovable assets:

- The staff complement of CGD's property valuation area has engineers and architects with significant experience in the valuations area. Those with technical approval functions have complementary training in the form of property valuation courses and are registered with and certified by the CMVM as property appraisers;
- CGD's network of external service providers in its property valuation area comprises external corporate and individual appraisers, registered with the CMVM and spread out over the whole of the country based on the area in which they perform their professional activity. There are several appraisers for each municipal district to ensure adequate diversification and rotation;
- Valuation requests are received by CGD in digital format, accompanied by the essential documentation for property valuation purposes. An internal technical operative is responsible for the approval process by type of valuation and the municipal district in which the property is located, and
- The appraisers are set out on a list defining the priority municipal districts for operational purposes, based on criteria of efficiency in terms of travel and in-depth knowledge of the local market. Valuation requests are delivered to appraisers via a CGD property management portal. The appraiser records the date of the visit and valuation report in the portal in a standardised format which includes the relevant documents for the valuation and photographs of the property.


# Other collateral 

In addition to the property, the following collateral is eligible for mitigating the calculation of credit impairment:

- Pledges over term deposits - assessed on the amount of the pledge;
- Pledges over bonds issued by CGD - assessed on the nominal value of the bonds; and
- Pledges over listed shares - assessed at market value at the calculation's reference date.

6. Type of principal judgments, estimates and hypotheses used to measure impairment

CGD's credit impairment model uses appropriate, well established methodologies to ensure that the impairment calculation is in conformity with IFRS 9 - "Financial instruments".

There are several modelling approaches CGD considers to be more adequate for impairment measurement purposes but which involve judgments in defining the processes, namely:

(i) Historical information considered for modelling purposes (PDs, LGDs, collateral haircuts);
(ii) Workout period for the calculation of LGDs and multiple default assessment methodologies;
(iii) Portfolio segmentation criteria:

- Loans and advances to personal customers: type of product (e.g. housing), purpose of loan, type of collateral, present and past performance of the operation, length of current performance, scoring level; and
- Lending to corporates: type of company, amount of exposure, sector of economic activity, quality and amount of collateral, present and past performance of the operation, length of current performance and rating.
(iv) Loan conversion factors applied to off-balance sheet exposures;
(v) Defined exposure level and risk criteria for individual impairment assessments;
(vi) Criteria used to measure significant increases in risk from the time of the financial instrument's initial recognition, incorporating forward-looking information; and
(vii) The credit loss is measured on the basis of three probable macroeconomic scenarios (optimistic, pessimistic and basic) which are reviewed every six months and whose respective risk factors are adjusted to each scenario upon which the expected losses are calculated.

7. Description of impairment calculation methodologies, including the way in which portfolios are segmented to reflect different loan characteristics

The credit impairment model used in CGD includes lending to corporate and personal customers. It also includes the provision of bank guarantees and irrevocable and revocable lines of credit, assessing each operation's risk profile which it classifies in the credit portfolio sub-segments defined on the basis of the operation's current and past performance.

The following concepts are used to calculate credit impairment:
(i) Individual impairment: This is based on an assessment of customers with individually significant exposures by filling in an impairment form and calculation template based on a going or gone concern approach; and
(ii) Collective or parametric impairment: This is automatically determined by the credit impairment model. Parametric calculations are performed on a level of each credit operation.

IFRS 9 - "Financial instruments" defines principles for the classification of operations and assets in the bank's portfolio, in accordance with their associated credit risk.

The following three risk stages, depending upon the deterioration of credit quality since the time of initial recognition, are considered:

- $\quad$ Stage 3: exposures with objective evidence of credit impairment, for operations in default;
- $\quad$ Stage 2: As exposures with a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition or with objective criteria of signs of impairment;
- $\quad$ Stage 1: exposures which cannot be classified in stages 2 or 3 .


# Stage 3 classification 

For securities and investment portfolios in other credit institutions, the definition of stage 3 is in alignment with the ratings issued by external rating agencies and considers all exposures with a D rating.

The definition of stage 3 for the credit portfolio is in alignment with CGD's definition of default. The following events are considered:

- Contractual defaults to CGD group, particularly credit materially overdue for more than 90 consecutive days;
- Existence of a material impairment provision resulting from an individual analysis of customers with individually significant exposures;

- Declaration of insolvency;
- An insolvency application, including PERs (special revitalisation programmes) submitted by the debtor or CGD;
- Operations at a litigation stage in CGD;
- Contamination of loans, based on the identification of loss events on other operations involving the same customer. In the case of loans and advances to personal customers, if the amount in default represents more than $20 \%$ of a customer's total exposure, the other operations are also classified as being in default;
- Restructured operations owing to a customer's financial difficulties, in a probation period, with new restructuring operations during the surveillance period of 2 years, when classified as a nonperforming exposure prior to the start of the probation period;
- Restructured operations owing to a customer's financial difficulties, in a probation period, with arrears of more than 30 days, when classified as a non-performing exposure prior to the start of the probation period; and
- Restructured operations owing to a customer's financial difficulties in the event of loss events (in accordance with the defined materiality).

Although IFRS 9 -"Financial instruments" does not define a concept of default, CGD uses the same definition as for management purposes, on an internal credit risk level, incorporating the EBA's recommendations in its "Final Report on Guidelines on Default Definition" (EBA-GL-2016-07), issued on September 28, 2016. Past events for modelling purposes reflect the definition of default at the said date.

# Stage 2 classification 

Stage 2 credit classification is based on the observation of a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since the time of initial recognition. The significant increase is generally measured on the change in the probability of default associated with the rating between the date of initial recognition and the reporting date. More specifically, a significant increase in credit risk is considered to exist in comparison to the initial recognition when one of the following criteria is noted:
(i) An absolute change in the forward-looking lifetime PD since origination, weighted by a residual maturity in excess of a certain threshold; and
(ii) A relative change in the forward-looking lifetime PD since origination in excess of a certain threshold.

Stage 2 classification also considers objective criteria of signs of default, classifying an exposure at this stage, whatever the deterioration in credit risk, as follows:

- Credit overdue in CGD for more than 30 days but not classified as being in default;
- Operations restructured owing to financial difficulties which do not meet stage 3 classification criteria;
- $\quad$ POCI (purchased or originated credit-impaired) operations which do not meet stage 3 classification criteria;
- Bank of Portugal indicators (amounts overdue to other credit institutions for more than 90 days and when customers are barred from using cheques);
- Cheques returned to CGD;
- Identification of debts to the tax authorities and social security services;
- A $20 \%$ decline in the value of real guarantees when resulting in an LTV of more than $80 \%$ (applicable to property projects);
- Interim grace periods;
- Insolvency processes other than a declaration of insolvency and PERs (special revitalisation processes);

- A rating corresponding to the lowest rating level (excluding default); and
- Three months' quarantine in stage 2 .


# Stage 1 classification 

Stage 1 includes all credit not meeting stages 2 and 3 classification criteria.
In this context, securities portfolios exposures that do not meet stage 2 or stage 3 criteria are also classified in stage 1.

The following risk factors must be assessed for calculating impairment losses in the collective analysis:
(i) Probability of default within 12 months (PD12m) - This is the probability of a performing loan registering a default event over the next 12 months. The impairment model incorporates PDs on a portfolio scoring and rating basis and PDs by sub-segment (purpose of loans and advances to personal customers and CAE (classification of economic activity) segment for loans to corporates and type of card for credit cards) applicable to the unrated portfolio;
(ii) Lifetime default probability (PDLT) - This is the probability of a loan defaulting up to the maturity of an agreement. Lifetime PDs are different for rated and unrated portfolios. In the case of rated portfolios, lifetime PDs are distinguished by the level of a customer's or operation's ratings. Lifetime PDs on unrated portfolios are different for customers or operations with:

- External signs accompanied by arrears of less than 30 days;
- Arrears of between 30 and 90 days and
- Restructured operations owing to financial difficulties with arrears of up to 30 days.
(iii) Loss given default (LGD) - A loss when an operation or customer defaults. LGD assessments involve observations of recoveries of operations or customers who default within the defined historical period, assessed in accordance with the length of default on each operation and each month of the historical period. The fact that LGDs are differentiated in line with the length of time the loan has been in default enables impairment losses to be differentiated by length of default. Some LGDs are differentiated on the basis of the type of collateral existing when impairment is assessed, and
(iv) Exposure at default (EAD) - is the amount of each operation's exposure upon the date of default. It comprises the sum of equity and off-balance sheet exposures following the CCF which is a credit conversion factor which measures the proportion of the off-balance sheet exposure which is converted into an equity exposure up to the date of default.

Estimations of risk factors, i.e. probabilities of default, include a forward-looking component based on macroeconomic scenarios which are updated every six months.

## 8. Indication of thresholds defined for individual analyses

The limits on individual impairment assessments, defined in an internal CGD group standard, take the specific characteristics of each group unit's diverse credit portfolios into account, with the objective of determining all exposures considered to be individually significant in each unit and the group. In the case of CGD and with reference to December 31, 2022, an individual analysis is performed on corporate customers whose exposure in conjunction with risk criteria, meets the following criteria:

- $\quad$ Stage 1: All customers with an exposure of $€ 20$ million or more or with an exposure of $€ 10$ million or more if the customer is showing signs of an increased risk (e.g. early warnings) or has a rating of less than 12 (on a scale of 1 to 15 excluding default);
- $\quad$ Stage 2: All customers with an exposure of $€ 10$ million or more or $€ 3$ million or more if the customer shows signs or warnings of increased risk (e.g. early warnings or more serious events) or has a rating of less than 12 (on a scale of 1 to 15 excluding default);
- $\quad$ Stage 3: Stage 3. All customers with an exposure of $€ 3$ million or more.

9. Policy on internal risk levels, specifying the treatment of a borrower classified as being in default

Under internal regulations, defaulting customers are allocated to specialised credit oversight and recovery areas. The decision may be made by the credit board or credit risks executive committee.

Owing to the innovation introduced by the customer oversight workflow process (item 1.1.2. above) as most defaulting customers had previously been allocated to recovery area managers, there were no breaks in the negotiating process which is initiated at the time of the transfer of customers from commercial to recovery areas.

The recovery solution considered most adequate to customers' and CGD's interests is applied, on the basis of an analysis, with litigation for credit recovery purposes as a last resort.
10. General description of the formo f calculating the presente value of future cash flows for individual and collective impairment loss assessments

# Individual assessment 

The assessment of expected future cash flows on loans considers the extent to which a customer will generate free cash flows for debt payment purposes. A loan's recoverable amount is the sum of the expected future cash flows, estimated in accordance with the contractual terms in force (maturity, interest rate, repayment method, etc.) in accordance with underlying expectations of collectability.

An assessment is made as to whether the estimations of the future cash flows of customers with signs of loss are less than the contractual cash flows. The amount of the impairment, in such cases, is consequently adjusted.

One of the following approaches is used to determine a company's future cash flows:
(i) A going concern approach which considers the continuation of a company's activity based on operating cash flow projections to determine whether they are sufficient to pay off the debt to all creditors. The sale or execution of collateral for debt settlement purposes may also be considered provided that this does not have any influence and impact on a company's estimated future cash flows (i.e. provided that they are non-operating assets). This going concern approach is used if:

- The company's future operating cash flows are material and can be adequately estimated; and
- The repayment of the debt does not involve the execution of collateral which is decisive for the company's normal operation.
(ii) A gone concern approach associated with a scenario involving the termination of the activity of a company whose collateral is executed and when the company's operating cash flows therefore cease to exist. The application of this approach is considered when at least one of the following situations occurs:
a) When the customer's exposure has been overdue for a considerable length of time with the presumption that the gone concern approach should be applied when the loan has been overdue for more than 18 months;
b) When estimated future operating cash flows are residual or negative or less than the estimated amount of the collateral and clearly insufficient to enable the customer to service its debt;
c) When the exposure is highly collateralised and the collateral is essential for producing cash flow
d) When the application of a going concern approach would have a material, negative impact on the recoverable amount as opposed to a gone concern approach;
e) When there is a high level of uncertainty over estimated future cash flows, namely when EBITDA over the last few years has been negative; and
f) When the available information for a going concern analysis is insufficient.

A mixed approach can be adopted in several situations, considering the cash flows produced by a company's activity which may be complemented by cash flows originating from disposals of the company's assets, assuming that the company will continue to operate as a going concern. If the disposal of the assets has an

impact on the company's future operating cash flows a respective adjustment will be made to determine the recoverable amounts.

# Collective impairment 

For stage 1 operations, the expected credit loss $E C L\left({ }^{3}\right)$ considers a 12 months' loss and is calculated by the following formula:

For stage 2 operations lifetime credit losses are calculated by the following formula:
In which $r$ represents the original interest rate and $S R$ represents the default's survival probability.
Given that the stage 3 concept is aligned with the internal default concept, a lifetime PD of $100 \%$ is considered. Expected losses on stage 3 operations are therefore given by the following formula:

Credit losses should also derive from the losses calculated on the basis of three possible macroeconomic scenarios (central, pessimistic and optimistic), weighted by the probabilities of each scenario's occurrence.

## Legal and corporate moratoria granted in the sphere of the Covid-19 pandemic

The moratoria granted in Portugal, for the purpose of mitigating the economic impacts of the pandemic, ended during 2021. These included corporate moratoria granted under the interbank protocol mentored by the Portuguese Banking Association and the legal moratoria published in decree law 10-J/2020.

However, at December 31, 2022, legal moratoria were still in place in Cape Verde and Macau, in due compliance with the local rules extending these economic support measures. Legal moratoria in CGD group are still, therefore, only in force in Banco Nacional Ultramarino in Macau.

The moratoria, granted at December 31, 2022 were distributed between performing and non-performing loans as follows:

To prepare CGD's efficient response to the pandemic's impacts on its credit portfolio, CGD reviewed its internal procedures for identifying customers likely to be most affected by the pandemic:
(i) Specific forward-looking analyses on the pandemic's potential impacts on CGD's activity for the corporate and personal customers' segments subscribing for the moratoria or in sectors considered most vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic (e.g. hotels and restaurants, transport, etc.);
(ii) A review of the classification criteria for operations/customers with restructured credit operations owing to financial difficulties and default, with their consequent allocation to stage 2 or stage 3, based on forward-looking and case-by-case analyses to identify situation involving the likelihood of receiving payment, with direct impacts on the level of measurement of the expected credit loss;
(iii) Definition of restructuring measures tailored to the risk perception on each customer in order to provide effective support to enable them to service their debt.

The process developed in response to the pandemic was incorporated into CGD's internal processes for responding to disruptive events or extraordinary situations having potentially negative impacts on its customers' economic-financial capacity with potentially less positive effects on the quality of the bank's credit portfolio.

When identifying disruptive events, the risk management division accordingly defines a proactive action plan, comprising the following guidelines:

- To identify customers potentially most vulnerable to the event in question;
- To define bottom-up or top-down analysis methodologies, including sensitivity analyses, based on a forward-looking approach to identify potential financial difficulties and mitigate any potential future defaults;
- To define rules and criteria on the rating of the potentially most vulnerable customers and the credit decision-making process;
- To develop dedicated credit risk monitoring processes on potentially vulnerable customers.


# Russia-Ukraine conflict - potential impacts on the credit portfolio 

CGD initiated an assessment of the potential impacts on its credit portfolio of the outbreak of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, based on the following approach:

- 1st order impacts related to exposures under the sanctions regime defined by the European Union have not been identified in CGD group;
- 2nd order impacts, related to direct or indirect exposures to Russiano r Ukrainian costumers were considered not to be relevant, as CGD group's exposure to these costumers is relatively imaterial;
- 3rd order impacts related to impacts on the credit portfolio resulting from an across-the-board deterioration of macroeconomic conditions.

To assess 3rd order impacts, CGD carried out several analyses with the aim of assessing the potential deterioration of its credit portfolio considering higher energy costs, interest rate hikes and rising inflation and existing constraints in production and distribution chains:

1. Identification of sectors considered most vulnerable to rising energy prices (comprising around 20\% of total exposure in the corporate segment):
a) An evaluation based on a forward-looking questionnaire, on a customer by customer basis, to identify situations of financial difficulties, with impacts on a level of stage 2 or stage 3 classification;

In this context, two rounds of questionnaires were conducted across the year. The last round was carried out in the last quarter of 2022 and also included customers from other sectors. The results particularly included the following:

- A relevant proportion of the exposure (79\%) was classified as showing no signs of increased risk (questionnaire with a score of 1) with the remaining $21 \%$ being

classified in the questionnaire with a need for continuous monitoring (scores of 2,3 or 4 ;

- The customers with the lowest scores (scores of 3 and 4 in the questionnaire) represent only $7 \%$ of the evaluated exposure and are, at a minimum, classified in stage 2 although it should be noted that, for a relevant proportion of such customers this result does not entail the worsening of the stage in which CGD had already classified the customer on the basis of other existing criteria.
b) Definition of more conservative tolerance levels in terms of decision-making and proactive credit restructuring processes;
c) The assumption that improvements of automatically generated ratings on costumers in these sectors will not show any improvements.

2. Sensitivity analysis on the loans and advances to personal customers portfolio:
a) Assessment of the impact of rising interest rates and inflation on customers' income;
b) Identification of any customer migrations to stage 2 or stage 3.

The analyses did not identify any material impacts for 2022 in terms of a significant deterioration of the quality of credit risk. The materialisation of several risks, particularly in the sectors most vulnerable to rising energy prices and/or those most affected by the pandemic, may lead to a deterioration of the portfolio's credit quality in 2023, leading to the recognition of overlays.

# Macroeconomic scenarios used in the impairment model 

The macroeconomic projections upon which the impairment model's forward-looking information is based are updated every six months with the definition of three scenarios with different probabilities of occurrence. Information on the economic indicators for each of the updated scenarios is set out in the following table:

## Additional impairment (overlays)

The abrupt nature of the recent unparalleled historical normalisation of monetary policy is especially relevant, particularly as it coincides with the deteriorating outlook on economic activity, as referred to in the financial stability reports of November 2022 published by the Bank of Portugal. The same report indicates a series of

financial system risks and vulnerabilities of which reference should be made to the materialisation of credit risk driven by the worsening current economic environment (rising energy prices, inflation, interest rates and constraints in supply and production chains) which could lead to an increase in situations of financial difficulties and non-performing loans (NPLs).

CGD has also carried out several analyses to identify any potential short and medium term deterioration of its credit portfolio, taking the current macroeconomic environment into account in which special reference should be made to rising interest rates and high levels of inflation. The eventuality of impacts on more vulnerable customers requiring measures under the Covid-19 pandemic was also considered, given a higher probability of migration of these customers to stage 2 or stage 3 . Based on the conclusions drawn from its analyses, CGD recognised additional impairment of €699,331 thousand to address potential expected losses not captured by the current impairment model, representing an increase of €45,754 thousand over the previous period. The increase is largely a result of the implementation of more conservative assumptions on customers in sectors most vulnerable to rising energy prices, the non-existence of rating improvements over the projection's horizon and rising inflation and interest rates in addition to the increased likelihood of the occurrence of an adverse scenario.

# Sensitivity analyses 

Owing to the high levels of uncertainty of macroeconomic projections and considering that deviations from the scenarios presented may have an impact on the expected amount of loss estimations, sensitivity tests on the distribution of the portfolio by stages and respective impact on impairment were carried out.

The following analyses were performed for this purpose:

1) Probability of occurrence of $100 \%$ for the favourable scenario;
2.a) Consideration of a probability of occurrence of $100 \%$ for the baseline scenario, assuming that the property market remains stable (i.e. no fall in property prices);
2.b) Consideration of a probability of occurrence of $100 \%$ for the baseline scenario, assuming slightly lower property market prices ( $5 \%$ reduction of property prices);
3.a) Consideration of a probability of occurrence of $100 \%$ for the severe scenario assuming that the property market remains stable (i.e. no fall in property prices);
3.b) Consideration of a probability of occurrence of $100 \%$ for the severe scenario, assuming slightly lower prices in the property market ( $5 \%$ reduction of property prices);
3.c) Consideration of a probability of occurrence of $100 \%$ for the severe scenario, assuming slightly lower prices in the property market ( $5 \%$ reduction of property prices);

The sensitivity analyses measure the impacts of the expected loss (ECL) and evolution of stage 1 and stage 2 resulting from the application of the different macroeconomic scenarios, in conjunction with different depreciation factors for collateral on property.

The impacts are measured against the calculation of impairment for December 2022, on CGD Portugal's credit portfolio whose expected losses are estimated on the basis of the weighting of the three macroeconomic scenarios: a central scenario with $60 \%$, favourable scenario with $15 \%$ and adverse scenario with $25 \%$.

The following tables provide information on the total impacts of sensitivity analyses on credit impairment and provisions for off-balance sheet exposures (e.g. bank guarantees provided and unused lines of credit), in addition to migrations of exposure between stage 1 and stage 2 deriving from the identification of a significant increase in credit risk in comparison to the time of the origination of operations, owing to a change of the lifetime default probability curves estimated for each scenario.

EAD: Exposure at default
The impact on impairment in the severe scenario may vary between $0.4 \%$ and $1.9 \%$, depending on the level of the fall of property market prices.

There would be a slight $0.7 \%$ reduction of impairment in the favourable scenario assuming that property prices remain stable. The impact on impairment in the central scenario may vary between $0.1 \%$ and $0.8 \%$, in line with lower property market prices.

Stage 2 exposure is slightly higher in the optimistic scenario in comparison to the baseline scenario. The fact that the inflation rate, which has a positive correlation with the probability of default (PD), is higher in the optimistic scenario and overlaps the positive effect of economic growth in the reduction of the PD explains the statistical effect observed.

# Restructuring funds 

The restructuring funds in which CGD has holdings (notably structures associated with asset lending operations - notes 7 and 8) are measured at their respective fair value by reference to the net asset value (NAV) reported by the fund manager and subject to the risk management division's internal analysis of the recoverable value of the assets held by these structures. The analysis may indicate the possibility of the

need for negative adjustments to the NAV of the restructuring funds and recognition of additional losses to those that would be recognised on the basis of the valuation reported by the fund managers.

This analysis derives from the internal policy approved by CGD's management bodies for the purposes of monitoring the risks inherent to exposures to restructuring funds, in line with the supervisor's recommendations for the furtherance of an adequate internal control and governance activity for the bank's profile and organisational structure with the objective of carrying out analyses making it possible to challenge the assumptions used by each fund manager.

The work is based on the development of alternative analysis methodologies used to measure the value of the funds' principal assets and accordingly gain a perception of the deviation potential from the NAV reported by the fund manager.

For its analysis of business restructuring funds, CGD evaluates the information it has available on the assets of each fund (representing at least $80 \%$ of NAV whenever possible), by verifying historical and projected EBITDA, when provided, and a sensitivity analysis on the fund managers' assumptions in measuring companies' NAVs (namely: discount rates, levels of sales growth, EBITDA margins) whenever available.

As the restructuring fund managers do not supply full information on the assumptions and respective rationale underpinning corporate valuations, CGD makes use of the internal information housed in its systems which it seeks to complement with the use of sectoral EBITDA multiples to challenge the NAV, i.e. producing a sensitivity analysis on asset valuations.

In the property component, CGD's real estate business division issues an opinion on the valuation of this type of assets, as opposed to the real estate valuations sent to it by the fund managers, applying depreciation rates according to the type of asset and its location. The real estate business division's opinion is used by the risk management division for comparison purposes with the NAV reported by the fund managers.

The analysis carried out by the real estate business division focuses on a prudential approach to future real estate marketing activities, taking into account aspects related to the long term sustainability of the property price, normal and local market conditions, in addition to current and possible alternative uses when elements of a speculative nature are not considered in the valuation. The analysis should also include the determination of external factors, such as the current shortages of raw materials, increase in the price of construction materials and labour (with double digit growth according to the most recent data published by the INE (National Statistics Institute) with the consequent increase in construction costs, hikes in inflation rates and reference interest rates, in addition to the constraints resulting from the current post-pandemic scenario and the effects of the war in Ukraine and macroeconomic changes having an impact on the disposable income of the principal economic actors.

As regards the quantitative information underlying the fair value measurement of the real estate restructuring funds in CGD's portfolio at December 31, 2022 information on valuations of the real estate analysed is summarised below:

|  Fund | Available evaluations vs. GAV(1) of the Fund (in \%) | Age of Evaluation Reports |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   |  | Percentage of evaluations carried out in the last 12 months |   |
|   |  | 1) number of analysed evaluations | In value of analysed evaluations  |
|  Fundo Imobiliário Aquarius | 100,00\% | 20,00\% | 24,55\%  |
|  Discovery Portugal Real Estate Fund | 100,00\% | 100,00\% | 100,00\%  |
|  Fundo Turismo Algarve, FCR | 100,00\% | 100,00\% | 100,00\%  |
|  Fundo Imobiliário Vega | 99,00\% | 80,00\% | 99,56\%  |

[^0] [^0]: (1) GAV: Gross Asset Value

The following table provides a sample of the assumptions underlying the available valuation reports on real estate assets broken down by type of asset:

| Type of Asset | Average occupancy rate |  |  |  | Average day value |  |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  | Minimum | Average | Maximum | Minimum | Average | Maximum |
| Hotels | $30.00 \%$ | $59.70 \%$ | $83.00 \%$ | 40 | 159 | 747 |
| Type of Asset | Revised rate |  |  | Capitalisation rate |  |  | Evaluation method |
|  | Minimum | Average | Maximum | Minimum | Average | Maximum |
| Hotels | $6.25 \%$ | $8.63 \%$ | $19.50 \%$ | $5.41 \%$ | $7.31 \%$ | $9.00 \%$ | Market and Income |
| Land under development | $5.00 \%$ | $10.18 \%$ | $19.40 \%$ | $5.40 \%$ | $7.05 \%$ | $8.50 \%$ | Market and Income |
| Comercial centers | $8.40 \%$ | $9.09 \%$ | $9.60 \%$ | $7.45 \%$ | $8.05 \%$ | $9.00 \%$ | Market and Income |
| Rustic land | $7.00 \%$ | $8.56 \%$ | $12.50 \%$ | $7.00 \%$ | $7.17 \%$ | $7.50 \%$ | Market and Income |
| Housing for sale | $5.00 \%$ | $7.28 \%$ | $8.50 \%$ | $5.21 \%$ | $5.61 \%$ | $6.00 \%$ | Market and Income |
| Income housing | $4.00 \%$ | $7.83 \%$ | $11.10 \%$ | $6.45 \%$ | $7.30 \%$ | $8.50 \%$ | Market and Income |
| Offices | $7.00 \%$ | $7.00 \%$ | $7.00 \%$ | $6.50 \%$ | $8.18 \%$ | $9.00 \%$ | Market and Income |

The following table provides information on average haircuts by asset type resulting from CGD's analysis of valuations (real estate assets) in comparison to the amount of the valuation:

| Type of Asset | Average Haircut <br> CGD Analysis in <br> Evaluation Value |
| :-- | :--: |
| Hotels | $-23.73 \%$ |
| Land under development | $-39.78 \%$ |
| Comercial centers | $-31.67 \%$ |
| Rustic land | $-55.00 \%$ |
| Housing for sale | $-22.14 \%$ |
| Income housing | $-28.81 \%$ |
| Offices | $-31.30 \%$ |

Several qualitative variables are used to determine haircuts. They include: (i) measurement assumptions used for property assets valuation purposes and (ii) the specific features of each individual asset. The assumptions used by appraisers are occasionally lacking in terms of the validation of the real situation in documentary, registration and physical terms (examination of the project's effective state of development, on-site visit, validation of documentation regarding the project, assets and licensing, in addition to its state of repair and occupancy status) and may compromise asset values, particularly as regards the presumed sales price or present value. In addition to the above mentioned issues related to the specific risk attached to each asset which include depreciation and wear of materials, project licensing status, use, size and singularity of projects, management quality, location and comparability with the competition and the dynamics of market supply/demand. All such non-observable factors may impact the value of the coefficients used and, accordingly, the fair value of investments in property restructuring funds.

These analyses have resulted in the reporting of gradual adjustments to the NAV of the restructuring funds.
The organised, open sales process mentored by ECS Capital at the request of CGD and other investors in 2021 and referred to as Project Crow was completed in 2022. It included 100\% of the shares of the FLIT PTREL SICAV fund, 100\% of the investment units in the Fundo de Recuperação de Turismo in addition to several hotel assets of the Fundo de Recuperação. This sale witnessed the creation of the Fundo de Turismo Algarve, FCR (FTA) which acquired a single asset from the Fundo de Recuperação de Turismo (FRT). CGD now has an equity stake in the FTA fund.

# Liquidity risk 

Liquidity risk represents the risk of negative impacts on profit or loss or capital resulting from insufficient liquidity to address idiosyncratic or systemic adverse events.

The management and liquidity risk tolerance strategy is in conformity with CGD group's risk appetite statement and is based on three pillars:
a) The maintenance of a stable, solid, safe liquidity profile, ensuring an adequate capacity to provide for liquidity stress situations;
b) The maintenance of stable funding sources and an adequate liquidity buffer based on the adoption of a proactive, market-oriented approach enabling the institution's balance sheet structure to be adapted to existing conditions;
c) Control of the risk exposure of the group's international entities, maintaining their independence in terms of fund-taking and capital adequacy.

The measurement of an institution's liquidity involves, inter alia, an assessment of the receipt of its cash flows in light of the amount of the liquidity of its assets to identify potential future net funding deficits.

Structural liquidity as opposed to the concept of contractual liquidity (based on the contractual considerations of the marketed products, specifically as regards their periods to maturity), incorporates, the existence of a buffer of high-quality liquid assets to meet an institution's liquidity requirements and expectations on the behaviour of retail customers. The above information therefore differs from the tables on contractual periods to maturity, in its use of the following assumptions:

- Debt and equity securities: reallocation of amounts with adequate liquidity to the "up to 1 month" bucket, except for collateralised debt securities which are allocated to buckets corresponding to the maturity of the operations they are collateralising;
- Customers' demand deposits and savings accounts without a defined maturity (CGD Portugal, France branch and BNU): distribution of balance by period-to-maturity buckets in accordance with internally developed studies and models;
- Customers' demand deposits (other CGD group entities): distribution of the core deposits balance (i.e. deposits comprising a stable funding source for lending operations) from the "up to 1 month" bucket to the "up to 6 years buckets" based on a uniform distribution of balances. This approach

endeavours to comply with the recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) on the average and maximum maturity of core deposits;

- In the special case of mortgage loans, the distribution of principal and interest flows took into consideration expectations of early repayment rates based on an analysis of the past performance of operations and present macroeconomic context.


# Interest rate risk 

Interest rate risk derives from the possibility that the cash flows associated with a certain financial instrument, or its fair value, may change as the result of a change in market interest rates.

## Short term or accounting perspective

The above tables include the amounts of outstanding principal, excluding accrued interest and value adjustments.

Their production was based on the following assumptions:
(i) Cash balances at central banks were classified in the up to 1 month column and customers' ondemand deposits were classified in the " $<=7$ days" column;
(ii) The difference between the nominal and market value of debt securities recognised at fair value is considered in the "indeterminate" column and includes the accrued interest component; and
(iii) Equity instruments were classified in the "indeterminate" column.

# Sensitivity analysis 

The following table shows the effect on the net interest income projections for CGD group of a parallel shift of $+50,+100$ and +200 bps on the yield curves for the financial years 2023 and 2022. The estimates were obtained from the interest rate gap in which a revised methodology was used for the projection for 2023. This projection is more conservative as it takes into account the existing $0 \%$ floors for customer deposits in lower rate scenarios and high pass-through rate of market rates on interest on customer deposits in higher rate scenarios.

## ESTIMATED CHANGE IN NET INTEREST INCOME

It should be noted that the information set out in the above table does not take into account structural balance sheet changes or interest rate risk management policies that could be adopted as a consequence of the sensitivity analyses.

Fair value was assessed on the following assumptions:
(i) The book value of balances payable on demand corresponds to their fair value;
(ii) The fair value corresponds to the respective net market price of listed debt issuances;
(iii) The fair value of the remaining financial instruments is measured on the basis of discounted cash flow models up to the maturity of the operations for both fixed and variable interest rate instruments. The contractual conditions of the operations and, additionally, for the estimated variable-rate instruments, the future cash flows, incorporating the forward rates implicit in the yield curve in force on the respective reference dates were considered for the purpose in question together with the use of discount curves appropriate to the type of instrument, including:

- Market interest rates, incorporating average spreads on new investment operations and credit institutions' resources; and
- Market rates incorporating average spreads on new lending operations and customers' deposits on like-for-like loans and deposits.
(iv) The "Balances not analysed" column essentially includes:
- Overdue credit, net of impairment; and

- The balances of several branches not included in CGD's centralised calculation.

At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the impact of parallel shifts of $+50,+100$ and $+200$ (bps) on yield curves for the fair value of financial instruments sensitive to interest rate risk, excluding derivatives, is set out in the following following tables:

# Fair value 

Within the framework of the procedure established in CGD group for determining fair value and to ensure that the principles of IFRS 13 are correctly considered: Fair value is understood as being the price that would be received on the divestment of a particular asset or to be paid on the transfer of a certain liability in a typical, orderly transaction between market participants at the date of the fair value measurement. This is, accordingly, an exit price (and not a purchase price), and should therefore be in line with market information. Fair value aims to include all factors that would be used by market actors in pursuit of their best economic interest.

CGD has produced internal regulations on the governance model used to measure the value of the group's financial instruments. They define the policies and procedures to be followed for the identification and measurement of financial instruments, control procedures and definition of the responsibilities of the actors involved in this process. To ensure the harmonisation of criteria within the group, an obligation for the positions originated in CGD group's trading rooms or positions in securities at fair value originated by the respective entities' other commercial areas to be systematically and correctly reflected in the financial markets' front-office system has been established. The use of a single system makes it possible to ensure that the models and procedures followed are consistent and employ the same assumptions. The market risks area of the risk management division, which is independent from the business area, is responsible for

a daily reassessment process that is intended to be robust, exhaustive and auditable and which not only involves consultations on the various prices, interest rates and exchange rates necessary for the valuation of all positions and all contracts registered in the front-office system but also for the periodic certification thereof.

In general, when determining fair value, the privileged source of information is the reference market for the asset in question or valuations which use standard market models with observable inputs which are available and accepted by the industry. The most representative level of fair value is therefore its market price. In the absence of a price, measurement techniques which maximise the use of relevant and observable market factors, in an endeavour to minimise the use of non-observable inputs or the use of measurement assumptions should be used.

The proposed change must be accompanied by an impact analysis in cases of a more structural intervention which may require corrections to the measurement approach (measurement model or structural change in risk factors). A proposal to change the measurement model or structural change in risk factors should be submitted for the consideration of the executive committee prior to implementation. The same applies for measurement approaches to positions in new instruments for which a measurement approach has not, as yet, been defined.

The above referred to processes and procedures are across-the-board to all levels of the fair value ranking. Details on the measurement techniques and specificities of financial instruments, can be found in the "Derivatives", "Debt instruments of financial and non-financial entities" and own "Equity instruments" section.

The form of measuring the fair value of financial instruments recognised in the financial statements, at fair value, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 may be summarised as follows:

|  | 31-12-2022 |  |  |  |

The preparation of the above table was based on the following criteria:

- Level 1 - Market prices. This column includes financial instruments measured on the basis of prices in active markets;
- Level 2 - Observable market inputs. This column includes financial instruments measured on the basis of internal models using, inter alia, observable market inputs (interest rates, exchange rates, ratings attributed by external entities). It also includes financial instruments measured on the basis of the bid prices supplied by external counterparties; and

- Level 3 - Other measurement techniques. This column includes financial instruments measured on the basis of internal models, prices supplied by external entities including non-observable market parameters or NAV (net asset value) as supplied by restructuring or closed-end fund management companies.

CGD has internal regulations defining the rules for the classification of the fair value ranking of instruments accounted for at fair value, in line with IFRS definitions. Quarterly and based on the price/valuation source of each financial asset, each operation is classified in terms its fair value ranking together with an analysis of the need to change the classification of any of these assets.

Information on financial instruments movements, classified in the "Other measurement techniques" column, in 2022 and 2021, is set out below:

At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 a positive shift of 100 bps on the yield curve used to discount estimated future flows on debt instruments measured by internal models, would result in decreases of around $€ 20.00$ thousand and $€ 36.80$ thousand in fair value in the balance sheet and revaluation reserves and results, respectively.

At December 31, 2022, equity instruments measured by other measurement techniques (level 3) essentially include investment structures measured on the basis of data on the net asset value of the underlying assets supplied by the management bodies or other information services providers.

# Unobservable inputs 

Quantitative information of unobservable inputs used to calculate level 3 valuations is presented below as at December 31, 2022:

| Financial instruments | Valuation Metric | Assumptions | Range of unobservable inputs |  |  | $1 / 10$ |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  |  |  | Low | Average | High |  |
| Equity instruments | DFC (Discounted Cash Flow) | Risk free rates | $5.2 \%$ | $5.7 \%$ | $6.2 \%$ | \% |
|  |  | Risk premiums | $5.5 \%$ | $5.5 \%$ | $5.5 \%$ | \% |
|  |  | Beta Coefficient | $48.0 \%$ | $58.0 \%$ | $68.0 \%$ | \% |
|  |  | Macroeconomic Data | $0.5 \%$ | $5.0 \%$ | $9.4 \%$ | \% |
|  |  | Perpetuity growth rates | $1.5 \%$ | $2.0 \%$ | $2.5 \%$ | \% |

| Debt instruments | Discounted Cash Flow | Yield Curve | $4.7 \%$ | $10.0 \%$ | $21.0 \%$ | \% |
|  |  | Conditional prepayment rate (CPR) | 5.5 | 22.0 | 87.0 | \% |

## Transfers between levels

Transfers between levels 1 and 2 of the fair value ranking, in 2022, were as follows:

|  | $31.12 .2022$ |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  | Assets at fair value through other comprehensive income |  |
|  | Transfers from level 1 to level 2 | Transfers from level 2 to level 1 |
| Debt instruments | 8,447 | 5,188 |
|  | 8,447 | 5,188 |

The amount of financial instruments transferred between valuation levels in the period ended December 31, 2022 corresponds to the above changes in the cross-level classification, as the valuation of such financial instruments has been measured using a price from a different source, which may imply the position's lower liquidity level or may be determined using inputs which are not directly observable in the market. In the case of derivatives, changes in level will generally be associated with the proportion of the CVA component compared to the instrument's total fair value. In the specific case of this financial year, most of the transfers between levels occurred in the case of debt financial instruments. Only transfers between levels 3 to level 2 are associated with interest rate derivatives, whose proportion of the CVA was below the defined threshold.

## Sensitivity analyses

The following table shows the main measurement methods used and the impact of the main variables used on their respective valuation, where applicable, for the relevant financial assets included in level 3 of the fair value ranking, excluding exposure to recovery funds:

![img-43.jpeg](img-43.jpeg)
(a) A sensitivity analysis was not carried out for these categories because they include financial assets of immaterial individual value.
(b) In the specific case of investment units valued according to the NAV provided by the respective management company, it is not reasonable to analyze the impact of changing the variables underlying the determination of the quotation by that entity.
(c) In the case of valuation via the book-value of equity, it is unreasonable to analyze the impact of changing the variables underlying the determination of the quotation.

# Derivatives 

Derivatives are traded in organised and OTC (over-the-counter) markets.
Listed derivatives operations are measured on prices taken from financial information systems (Reuters/Bloomberg).

OTC derivatives are measured using commonly accepted theoretical, reasonably complex models, depending on the characteristics of the product in question:

- Discounted future cash flows based on an adequate yield curve; and
- Measurements based on statistical models, accepted in the market, such as Black \& Scholes.

The type of inputs necessary for the measurement also depends upon the operations' characteristics, which generally include yield curves, volatility curves, equities/indices prices, exchange rates and dividend yields.

Yield curves are produced on deposit rates and swap prices taken from Reuters/Bloomberg. An adjustment based on interest rate futures or FRAs (forward rate agreements) is applied to currencies with the highest exposure levels. Different future yield curves are obtained for future cash flows, depending on the period of the operation's indexer.

Volatility curves are produced on the basis of implicit volatilities in the prices of listed options on the underlying asset. Past volatility is calculated on the basis of the historical price of a series of its component parts if there are no listed options for an underlying asset.

The prices of shares/indices, exchange rates and dividend yields are supplied by Reuters/Bloomberg.
Under IFRS 13 - "Fair value measurement" requirements, CGD incorporated add-ons to its measurement of the said financial instruments to reflect its own credit risk based on a market discount curve it considers to reflect the associated risk profile. Based on its current exposure, the group also adopted a similar methodology to reflect counterparty credit risk on derivatives with positive fair value. The fair value obtained accordingly comprises the risk-free measurement affected by this addition.

Credit value adjustments and debit value adjustments - CVAs/DVAs - are determined by a methodology implemented on a Caixa group level. This methodology is based on an estimation of exposure at the time of default (exposure at default or EAD) for each operation and the application of risk parameters on the estimated EAD to determine CGD's expected loss (CVA) and that of the counterparty (DVA).

In the case of interest rate swaps, EAD is estimated for various future dates by modelling swaptions, thus enabling the incorporation of the operations' future potential exposure. For the remaining products, EAD usually corresponds to an instrument's fair value on the reference date.

The risk parameters consist of probabilities of default (PDs) and loss given defaults (LGDs) and are determined centrally by the group on the basis of the following criteria:
(i) For counterparties or projects with listed debt or available credit default swap prices, the group infers the prices' underlying risk parameters which it uses in the calculation; and
(ii) The remaining counterparties or projects are classified by credit quality based on a set of quantitative and qualitative criteria, resulting in an internal rating the group matches to a historical PD.

The value of credit value adjustments (CVAs) as recognised in the "Financial assets held-for-trading" account and DVAs recognised in the "Financial liabilities held-for-trading" account at December 31, 2022 totalled €984 thousand and €438 thousand respectively (€8,335 thousand and €704 thousand, respectively, at December 31, 2021).

# Debt instruments of financial and non-financial entities 

Whenever possible, these securities are measured at market prices, based on an internally developed algorithm. This algorithm endeavours to obtain the most adequate price for each security in accordance with a range of contributors defined internally by CGD. Price changes are analysed daily with the aim of ensuring the quality of the prices used.

In general the inputs used for internal valuations are supplied by Bloomberg and Refinitiv (e.g. Thomson Reuters) systems. There are, however, several securities for which market prices cannot be obtained: assets classified at levels 2 and 3. The prices of these securities are measured by the use of theoretical internal/external valuations.

The measurements are generally based on estimations of future discounted cash flows. They may be forecast by a reasonably complex model ranging from simple discounted cash flows resulting from forward rates based on the most adequate yield curve, which, in turn, is produced on the basis of money market rates and swap prices, whose money market component is adjusted by interest rate futures or FRAs to a CLO (collateralised loan obligation) cascade payment. For discount purposes, internal measurements use a listed credit curve complying with the currency/sector/rating trinomial to consider the risk attached to each issuance.

Segmentation between levels 2 and 3 is essentially associated with the viability of the direct observation of input sources for measurement purposes. The measurements provided by structurers, issuing entities or counterparties (external measurements) are generally allocated to level 3 as are securitisations with reduced liquidity.

The specific case of mortgage-backed securities and other assets (MBS/ABS) includes residential and commercial MBSs and other ABSs. ABSs have specific characteristics as they may have different underlying assets and issuing entities with different capital structures. As this type of asset is not generally quoted in regulated markets, it is necessary to resort to standard industry measurement models that make the greatest possible use of available observable inputs. Industry standard models calculate payments of principal and interest based on assumptions that can be independently tested. Inputs include, inter alia, conditional prepayment rates, prepayment speeds, loss assumptions (timing and severity), discount rates (spread, interest rate or discount margin). These inputs/assumptions are, whenever possible, are given by real transactions, external market research and market indices. These types of assets are generally classified at level 3 given the need to assume certain assumptions to establish a valuation.

## Own capital instruments

Whenever possible, own equity instruments are measured at market prices taken from the financial market/index in which they were traded. In the case of shares and funds which are not listed in a regulated market, the measurement shall be made using external valuations for the position's constituent parts. The measurements may be based on the DCF (discounted cash flow) model in which future flows for shareholders and creditors are analysed and estimated and subsequently updated by discounting a weighted average rate of costs of capital (WACC). If, owing to the immateriality of the position in the balance sheet, the request for an external valuation is not justified, the position is revalued on the basis of the entity's book value.

Yield curves are produced using money market rates and swap prices. Euro and USD yield curves are adjusted by the market price of interest rate futures and/or FRAs.

The values of the curves of the currencies with the highest levels of exposure, at December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were as follows:

|   | $31-12-2022$ |  | $31-12-2021$ |   |

# Reform of "IBOR" rates 

Following the decisions taken by regulators worldwide to replace many so-called "IBOR" rates, several national taskforces were set up with the support of the same regulators, for the purpose of helping the industry find alternative rates to accommodate principles of greater transparency and robustness.

The solution found, recommended by most financial regulators, was the use of interest rates supported by overnight transactions, commonly known as risk-free rates.

To conform with the ongoing reforms CGD set up an internal taskforce at the end of 2018 for the continuous oversight of the approaches and developments being proposed in the rates reform context. The taskforce was made up of employees from the legal, financial, operational, commercial, technological and compliance components, mentored by the chief financial officer (CFO) and took the form of regular meetings to assess the evolution of the works and the involvement of the CALCO (capital, assets and liabilities committee) for the most relevant decisions.

As a result of this reform, the European Central Bank, in summer 2019, asked the main credit institutions to provide action plans on this issue pursuant to which CGD prepared its plan which was successively updated in line with the various scheduled rate changes.

To provide for the possibility of litigation and the administrative burden associated with contractual changes in legacy transactions, particularly with financial counterparties, CGD accordingly subscribed for the "ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol" on January 8, 2021 which allowed it, in situations in which another counterparty has also subscribed for the protocol, to apply the terms laid down in the said protocol.

CGD successfully completed the transition of the LIBOR rate on the currencies with a closing date of December 31, 2021. The transition of the USD LIBOR component which will take place by June 30, 2023 is at its completion phase. No major constraints have been identified in this last stage.

In the context of LIBOR, CGD has also, when possible, compressed transactions in derivatives and their respective settlement in the form of central clearing operations, both on rate operations which have already been terminated and the termination of the USD LIBOR component which will occur up to the end of June 2023.

In commercial terms, the volume of existing operations and their aggregate value are relatively contained, although bilateral talks continue to be held with customers for the purpose of changing the USD LIBOR USD rate still existing in legacy contracts.

The main risks identified, monitored and managed by CGD in the LIBOR transition encompassed, but were not limited to, categories such as:

- The legal risk of possible litigation deriving from contractual changes;
- Financial risk for CGD and its customers owing to changes made during the ongoing reform;
- Measurement risk on assets under CGD management;
- Operational risk in changing the systems upon which interest rate indices activity is based;

- Accounting risk in defining that contractual cash flows are economically equivalent in terms of rate substitutions;
- Reputational risk on customers' failure to perceive present or future changes.


# Market risk 

Market risk is the risk of a change in the fair value or cash flows of financial instruments based on changes in market prices including foreign exchange, interest rate and price risks.

Market risk is determined by the following metrics:
(i) Value at risk (VaR) on the following portfolios:

- Held-for-trading portfolio: perimeter of held-for-trading positions and transactions originating in CGD group;
- Trading portfolio: includes securities and derivatives traded with the objective of detecting business opportunities over the short term;
- Own portfolio: securities acquired for investment purposes upon which deleveraging operations are currently being performed;
- Investment portfolio: with the aim of creating a value and liquidity reserve. It includes the remaining securities in CGD's own portfolio and associated hedges, except for equity stakes and securitised credit;
- Treasury management activity: comprising money market funding, derivatives associated with this activity and debt issuances exposed to market risk;
- Branches France; and
- Subsidiaries - Caixa Banco de Investimento, BCG Brazil, BCI and BNU.
(ii) Sensitivity analysis on all financial instruments sensitive to interest rate risk, managed by the trading rooms and recognised in CGD's and the following group subsidiaries' separate financial statements:
- Caixa - Banco de Investimento;
- BCI; and,
- BNU.
(iii) Sensitivity analysis on all financial instruments with optionality; and
(iv) Stress-Tests.

VaR (value at risk) - market risk
VaR (value at risk) is the estimated maximum unrealised loss on a specific assets portfolio over a given timeframe, considering a given confidence level based on normal market patterns.

The calculation methodology is based on historical simulation, i.e. future events are fully explained by past events, based on the following assumptions:

- Holding period: 10 days (investment and own portfolios) and 1 day (trading portfolio and treasury management activity);
- Confidence level: 99\% (investment and own portfolios) and 95\% (trading portfolio and treasury management activity);
- Price sample period: last 500 observations; and
- Decay factor=1, i.e., all past observations carry the same weight;

The theoretical price for options is calculated by the use of adequate models and implied volatility. Given the methodology used, correlations are not calculated but are empirical.

The following is a breakdown of VaR, at December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021:

# 44. Capital management 

## Capital management objectives

Capital management objectives, in Caixa, are governed by the following general principles:

- To comply with the supervisors' regulatory requirements, in particular the European Central Bank, Bank of Portugal, National Council of Financial Supervisors and the Single Resolution Board, as regards MREL;
- To generate an adequate level of return for the company, creating value for its shareholder and return on capital employed;
- To sustain the development of operations that CGD is legally authorised to perform, maintaining a solid capital structure, capable of providing for the growth of activity and in line with its respective risk profile; and
- To protect the bank's and group's reputation, maintaining the integrity of the operations performed during the course of their activity.

To achieve the objectives described, Caixa plans its capital needs and liabilities eligible for MREL over the short and medium term, with a view to financing its activity and ensuring its capacity to absorb losses and recapitalise in adverse scenarios.

This planning is based on internal estimates of the evolution of balance sheet operations and financing based on borrowing operations and primarily comprises the issuance of subordinated debt, subject to certain conditions, in addition to senior preferred and non-preferred debt issuances for MREL purposes.

## Evolution of regulatory and supervisory framework

The activity of credit institutions in Portugal is governed by the general credit institutions and financial corporations regime approved by decree law 298/92, which plays a primary role in Portuguese prudential regulation in largely reflecting Community directives applicable to the financial system (directives 2006/48/EC, 2006/49/EC and 2010/76/EU).

With the coming into force, in January 2014, of the new Basel III regulatory framework (regulation (EU) 575/2013 and directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council both of which dated June 26), applicable to all European Union member states and defining the prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms, the regulatory framework provided for a series of transitional provisions permitting the staged application of the new capital requirements, with more restrictive requirements on the calculation of capital quality and risk-weighted assets. The competent authorities of the member states are entitled to maintain or accelerate their implementation.

The principal impacts of regulation (EU) 575/2013 (CRR/CRD IV) on capital ratios were on deferred tax assets (DTAs), provisions for impairment deficits on loss projections, pension fund corridor, non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries, significant equity stakes in non-consolidated financial institutions and additional market and counterparty risk requirements.

The Bank of Portugal, herein, issued notice 6/2013 which regulates the transitional regime of regulation (EU) 575/2013, having established the transitional implementation of the impacts of own funds elements.

With the coming into force of regulation (EU) 2016/445 of the European Central Bank, on October 1, 2016, credit institutions ceased to consider the percentage applicable to unrealised profit as defined by article 468, 1 of regulation (EU) 575/2013 in the calculation of their CET 1 components, including the profit on positions at risk in central governments recognised in the "available-for-sale" category and thus accelerating the implementation of the transitional provisions.

In November 2016, the European Commission published a draft of the new CRR and CRD IV, incorporating different Basel standards such as the "Fundamental Review of the Trading Book for Market Risk, a Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)" for liquidity risk, interest rate risk in the banking book in addition to modifications relating to the treatment of central counterparties, MDA (minimum distributable amount), Pillar 2, leveraging ratio and Pillar 3, inter alia.

The most significant change was the implementation of the TLAC (total loss absorbing capacity) term sheet, internationally defined by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in the capital structure. Consequently, systemically important banks must comply with MREL/TLAC requirements under Pillar 1, as opposed to banks that are not systemically important which need only comply with MREL in the sphere of Pillar 2 to be decided by the resolution authority on a case by case basis.

In December 2017, the Bank of Portugal published its notice 10/2017, revoking notice 6/2013 and defining a new structure for the gradual application of deductions from own funds, particularly including, on account of their relevance, deferred tax assets which are contingent upon future returns, starting January 1, 2018.

The same period also witnessed the publication of regulation (EU) 2017/2395 of the European Parliament and of the Council, amending regulation (EU) 575/2013 on the transitional regime for reducing the impact of the introduction of IFRS 9 - "Financial instruments" on own funds and for the treatment of major risks to certain positions at risk in the public sector in the domestic currency of any member state.

CGD did not subscribe for the possibility of the progressive application of a transitional regime as provided for in the above referred to regulation. The estimated impact on both the phased-in and fully implemented CET 1, is -25 bps .

On April 17, 2019, the European Parliament and the Council of the Union published regulation (EU) 2019/630, amending regulation (EU) 575/2013 on the minimum coverage for losses on non-performing exposures (NPEs), with a view to preventing the excessive accumulation of NPEs in the future and preventing the emergence of systemic risks in the non-banking sector.

This regulation complemented the prudential rules of regulation (EU) 575/2013 on provisions requiring a deduction from own funds when NPEs are not sufficiently covered by provisions or other adjustments.

The regulation defined that institutions shall deduct the amount of insufficient cover for non-performing exposures from CET 1 own funds if the exposure originated after April 26, 2019.

Regulation 2019/876 (CRR II), amending regulation 575/2013 and directive 2019/878 (CRD V) was published in May 2019.

The amendments under the CRR II focus on the leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, own funds requirements and eligible liabilities, counterparty credit risk, market risk, positions at risk of central counterparties, collective investment undertakings' risks, large exposures and information and disclosure requirements.

The CRD V entered into force on June 27, 2020, applicable from December 28, 2020, in order to give member states time to transpose it into national legislation.

The CRR II entered into force on June 28, 2021, with several exceptions that had entered into force during the period starting January 1, 2019.

These exceptions particularly include, inter alia, the entry into force, on June 27, 2019, of the main changes to capital, own funds deductions and determination of credit risk based on the standard and IRB method.

The Covid-19 pandemic forced supervisors to adopt a set of measures designed to ensure that banks would retain their capacity to absorb losses and their capacity to fund the economy, as referred to in the following items:

# a) Requirement to set up a capital buffer 

In September 2015, the Bank of Portugal's notice 1/2015, instructed credit institutions headquartered in Portugal to bring forward the application of the own funds conservation buffer of $2.5 \%$, under article 138-D of the general credit institutions and financial corporations regime.

Consideration of the context of the single supervisory mechanism (SSM) in which credit institutions' capitalrelated decisions are assessed and adopted for the whole of the euro area with the capital operations deriving from such decisions essentially comprising recourse to the market, required the need to ensure that national credit institutions should operate under the same conditions as the majority of institutions in the same space.

As such, the Bank of Portugal issued notice 6/2016 of May 31, revoking notice 1/2015, as it considered that bringing forward the application of the own funds conservation buffer, under the terms of notice 1/2015 could prejudice the existence of such conditions and entail the subjection of the entities to the transitional regime of nos. 1 to 4 of article 23 of decree law 157/2014 of October 24.

## b) Requirement to set up a capital buffer for "Other systemically important institutions"

Pursuant to article 138-Q of the general credit institutions and financial corporations regime and in accordance with European Banking Authority (EBA) guidelines for the identification of "Other systemically important institutions - OSIIs), the Bank of Portugal identified CGD as an O-SII and informed the European Banking Authority and the European Central Bank thereof.

The practical consequence of this decision for CGD consists of the obligation to set up an O-SII buffer totally covered by CET 1, on a consolidated basis.

The amount of this capital buffer was set by the Bank of Portugal at $1 \%$ for CGD and a decision made to implement it on a staged basis, with the application of $0.25 \%$ per annum between 2018 and 2021, in conformity with its decision announced on November 30, 2017.

However, in May 2020, the Bank of Portugal, as part of the measures designed to mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, announced a one year postponement of the period of gradual implementation of this requirement.

CGD's consolidation perimeter must therefore have a capital buffer of $0.25 \%$ in $2018,0.50 \%$ in $2019,0.75 \%$ in 2020 and 2021 and $1 \%$ in 2022 (inclusive), pursuant to its status as an OSII.

## c) Requirement to set up a countercycle buffer

According to the Basel Committee, the principal objective of the countercycle buffer is to ensure that banks have a sufficiently large capital buffer to enable them to absorb unexpected losses when facing a negative systemic shock and therefore not compromising their lending to the real economy.

The Bank of Portugal, in fulfilling its role as the national macroprudential entity, may force credit institutions to set up an additional own funds buffer with the objective of protecting the banking sector in periods of increased cyclical systemic risk owing to excessive credit growth.

The countercycle buffer (measured as a percentage of the total amount of positions at risk) will be set at between $0 \%$ and $2.5 \%$, unless a higher percentage is justified by exceptional circumstances.

The buffer's percentage for each institution, i.e. the "percentage of an institution's specific countercycle buffer" is a weighted average of the countercycle buffer's percentages applicable in the countries in which an institution's credit risk positions are located.

For 2022 the Bank of Portugal set the countercycle buffer at $0 \%$ of the total amount of positions at risk.

It should be pointed out that a default on any of the previously identified buffers (O-SII, countercycle buffer and specific buffer) does not call the continuity of an institution's activity into account. It does, however, imply restrictions on the distribution of dividends and share buy-backs, in addition to a requirement for the said institutions to submit a properly scheduled own funds conservation plan to the Bank of Portugal with the objective of fully complying with the combined own funds requirement. The Bank of Portugal is responsible for defining the timeframe for implementing the plan.

# d) Capital requirements for the consolidated perimeter in conformity with the SREP 

## Capital requirements in 2022

Based on supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) results and the Bank of Portugal's communication on the additional capital buffer required pursuant to its O-SII (other systemically important institutions) status, CGD was notified by the European Central Bank (ECB) of its minimum capital requirements in 2022, more details on which are latterly provided.

In its letter of February 2, 2022, the ECB defined the obligation for CGD to comply with a minimum total SREP capital requirement (TSCR) of $10.0 \%$ (of which $8.0 \%$ for Pillar 1 and $2.0 \%$ for Pillar 2 - P2R), with a phased-in CET 1 ratio of $9.125 \%$ on a consolidated basis, which includes:
(i) a minimum CET 1 ratio required by Pillar 1 de 4,5\%;
(ii) a minimum CET 1 ratio required by Pillar 2 (P2R) of 1,125\%;
(iii) a capital conservation buffer (CCB) of 2,50\%;
(iv) an "other systemically important institutions" buffer of 1.0\%; and
(v) a countercyclical capital reserve of $0 \%$ of the total amount of positions at risk (as defined by the Bank of Portugal for fourth quarter 2022).

CGD must also achieve a minimum tier 1 ratio of $11.00 \%$ and a total capital ratio of $13.50 \%$ in 2022.
As regards the own funds buffer for "Other systemically important institutions" (O-SII), the Bank of Portugal defined a gradual phasing-in period of $0.25 \%$ per annum between 2018 and 2021, with the requirement in the last period expected to be $1 \%$.

However, to allow the banking system to mitigate the shock of the economic and financial conditions deriving from the Covid-19 pandemic, the Bank of Portugal extended the possibility of delaying the period for full compliance with the O-SII buffer percentage for another year. CGD was informed of this decision in May 2020.

The phased implementation period of the own funds buffer for "Other Systemically Important Institutions" ended at the close of 2021, with a requirement of $1 \%$ starting 2022.

On September 30, 2022, the Bank of Portugal announced that the value of the countercyclical own funds buffer would remain at $0 \%$.

CGD must therefore achieve the following minimum ratios in 2022:

| 2022 |  |  |  |  |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Indicator | Minimum Ratio | Composition of the minimum ratio |  |  |  |
|  |  | Pillar 1 | Pillar 2 | $\begin{gathered} \text { Buffers } \\ \text { Conservation } \end{gathered}$ | O-SII |
| CET 1 | $9,13 \%$ | $4,50 \%$ | $1,13 \%$ | 2,50\% | $1,00 \%$ |
| Tier 1 | $11,00 \%$ | $6,00 \%$ | $1,50 \%$ | 2,50\% | $1,00 \%$ |
| Total Capital | $13,50 \%$ | $8,00 \%$ | $2,00 \%$ | 2,50\% | $1,00 \%$ |

Capital requirements for 2023
On December 14, 2022, the European Central Bank (ECB) informed CGD of the minimum prudential requirements applicable in 2023, particularly the Pillar 2 requirement of $1.90 \%$, comprising a reduction of $0.10 \%$ over 2022. This second consecutive downward revision of the Pillar 2 requirement shows that the supervisor recognises the positive evolution of the overall risk attached to CGD.

Based on this SREP decision and the Bank of Portugal's announcement on the additional capital buffer required by its O-SII (other systemically important institution) status, Caixa Geral de Depósitos, S.A. must achieve a total ratio (TSCR) of $9.90 \%$ on a consolidated basis in 2023 (of which $8 \%$ for Pillar 1 and 1.90\% for Pillar 2 - P2R), with the value of the P2R defined for CGD being $56.25 \%$ covered by CET 1 instruments, $18.75 \%$ by AT 1 instruments and $25 \%$ by tier 2 instruments, applicable starting and including March 2023.

CGD's minimum phased-in CET 1 requirement, on a consolidated basis, is now therefore $9.069 \%$ and includes:
(i) a minimum CET 1 ratio required by Pillar 1 of 4,50\%;
(ii) a minimum CET 1 ratio required by Pillar 2 (P2R) of 1,069\%;
(iii) a capital conservation buffer (CCB) of 2,50\%;
(iv) an "Other systemically important institutions" buffer of 1.0\%; and
(v) a countercyclical own funds buffer of $0 \%$ of the total amount of positions at risk (as defined by the Bank of Portugal for first quarter 2023).

CGD must also achieve a minimum tier 1 requirement of $10.925 \%$ and a total capital ratio of $13.40 \%$ in 2023, as shown in the following table:

| 2023 |  |  |  |  |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Indicator | Minimum Ratio | Composition of the minimum ratio |  |  |  |
|  |  | Pillar 1 | Pillar 2 | $\begin{gathered} \text { Buffers } \\ \text { Conservation } \end{gathered}$ | O-SII |
| CET 1 | 9,07\% | 4,50\% | 1,07\% | 2,50\% | 1,00\% |
| Tier 1 | 10,93\% | 6,00\% | 1,43\% | 2,50\% | 1,00\% |
| Total Capital | 13,40\% | 8,00\% | 1,90\% | 2,50\% | 1,00\% |

# Regulatory capital 

CGD's regulatory capital in its consolidated perimeter, includes the following components:
a) Common equity tier 1 (CET1)

The net equity components making a positive contribution to CET 1 in December 2022 are:

- Share capital;
- Other reserves and retained earnings;
- Net profit for period ${ }^{4}$;
- Revaluation reserves; and
- Non-controlling interests (prudential).

Deductions related to the following are made to the above referred to positive components:

- The net book value of intangible assets;
- The book value of deferred tax assets (tax losses);
- The amount of the funding surplus of the defined benefit pension fund based on the application of item (109) of article 4, no. 1, sub-paragraph e), article 36 no. 1, and article 41 of the CRR ;
- The irrevocable commitments associated with the deposit guarantee fund and resolution fund, as decided by the supervisor (SREP decision of 2017);
- AVA (asset valuation adjustments) resulting from the application of articles 34 and 105 of regulation (EU) 575/2013 - on the prudent assessment of all trading portfolio positions; and
- NPE - non-performing exposures (or prudential backstop): insufficient coverage for defaulting exposures, as defined in sub-paragraph $m$ of article 36 and no. 1 of article 47-C of the CRR.

The framework governing the composition of own funds, in addition to its applicable deductions is explained in the market discipline report for the period, which is available on CGD, S.A.'s website.

## b) Additional tier 1 capital

In December 2022, additional tier 1 own funds derive exclusively from the contribution of the non-controlling interests of subsidiaries, as, following the ECB's authorisation for the repayment of $€ 500,000$ thousand in AT 1 instruments under CGD's recapitalisation process implemented in 2017, they are no longer considered as additional tier 1 capital (detailed information in repayment of AT 1 instrument).

## c) Additional tier 2 capital

Tier 2 own funds include the instruments issued or subordinated loans contracted and fully paid up, in addition to the contribution of subsidiaries' non-controlling interests.

The details of instruments eligible as tier 2 own funds are set out in the market discipline report, which is available on CGD's website.

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{4}$ The inclusion of net profit for the period in own funds in accordance with decision (EU) 2015/656 of the European Central Bank, with no. 2 of article 26 of regulation (EU) 575/2013 (ECB/2015/4) and approved by the supervisor.

CGD's solvency indicators in 2022 are at comfortable levels in comparison to the capital requirements for its consolidated activity and exceed the levels of the same period last year, as the improvement in own funds has made it possible to accommodate the increase in risk-weighted assets (RWAs):

| Total | $13.5 \%$ | $13.5 \%$ |
| Surplus (buffers) |  |  |
| CET 1 | $9.6 \%$ | $9.2 \%$ |
| Tier 1 | $7.7 \%$ | $7.3 \%$ |
| Total | $6.7 \%$ | $6.2 \%$ |

Notes:
The calculated values apply to the Phasing-in and Full Implementation
Equity includes the positive net result for the period approved by the Supervisor, pursuant to Article 26 (2) of Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013.

For the determination of own funds and consolidated prudential ratios at December 31, 2022, as reported to the supervisor, a net profit of $€ 483,723$ thousand was considered, as authorised by the ECB, under no. 2 or article 26 of regulation (EU) 575/2013 and article 5 of decision (EU) 2015/656 of the European Central Bank of February 4, 2015 on the inclusion of interim or year-end profits in common equity tier 1 capital, which amount was determined on net accounting profit of $€ 837,759$ thousand net of around $€ 354,036$ thousand for the maximum amount of distributable dividends in accordance with the preceding year's dividend payment ratio (implementation of decision (EU) 2015/656 of the ECB - conditions under which credit institutions may include interim or year-end profits in common equity tier 1).

Differences between the consolidation method for accounting purposes and the consolidation method for the purposes of calculating regulatory capital.

The prudential consolidation perimeter differs from CGD group's accounting perimeter in its treatment of entities whose economic activity is different from the activity characterising credit institutions and financial corporations as referred to in the "general credit institutions and financial corporations regime". Subsidiaries operating in economic sectors not subject to prudential supervision (e.g. commerce, industry, agriculture and insurance) are recognised in the prudential consolidation perimeter by the equity accounting method.

Several collective investment entities within the group, in addition to special purpose vehicles were not included in the banking supervision perimeter as they are not classifiable as financial corporations, as referred to in the "general credit institutions and financial corporations regime".

It should also be noted that BCG Brazil, CGD Investimentos CVC and Banco Comercial do Atlântico are recognised in the perimeter in accordance with IFRS 5 - "Non-current assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations" (the assets of such entities have been recognised in a single consolidated assets account, in "Non-current assets held-for-sale" as opposed to liabilities which have been recognised in "Non-current liabilities held-for-sale"). These entities have been consolidated in the prudential perimeter on an account by account basis.

The following branches, subsidiaries, special purpose entities and associates were included in CGD group's consolidation perimeter at December 31, 2022:

Work continued on the corporate reorganisation of CGD group in 2022 for the purpose of furthering its strategic plan:

- end of the Nostrum Mortgage 2 securitisation operation on August 22, 2022;
- disposal of the equity stake in Esegur, S.A. on July 28, 2022;
- $70 \%$ increase in the equity stake in Banco Interatlântico, S.A.R.L. to $81.69 \%$ through the purchase of the equity investment previously held by the minority shareholder Empreitel Figueiredo S.A. on August 3, 2022 ;
- $90 \%$ increase in the equity investment in Caixa Serviços Partilhados, ACE to 100\% in June 2022;
- increase in the share capital of Caixa - Banco de Investimento, S.A. to 100\% based on a potestative acquisition completed in December 31, 2022;

As part of the Crow project CGD group achieved 100\% ownership of the company Flitptrel IV, S.A. on December 27, 2022, which company, in turn, owns the full amount of the share capital of Flitptrel Porto Santo, S.A.

Lastly, reference should be made to the fact that:

- S.G.P.I.C.E - Sociedade de Serviços de Gestão de Portais na Internet e de Consultoria de Empresas, S.A (ex: Yunit Serviços, SA) is still suspended from the consolidation process, and
- Companhia Papel do Prado, S.A. ceased to be a CGD group member on May 31, 2022.

MREL - Minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities

## Regulatory framework

The single resolution mechanism (SRM) as the 2nd banking union Pillar defines the bank resolution framework across all participating member states. The SRM aims to ensure the orderly resolution of failing

banking institutions at minimal costs for taxpayers and the real economy. To this end, regulation (EU) no. 806/2014 - the single resolution mechanism regulation (SRMR) and directive 2014/59/EU - Bank recovery and resolution directive (BRRD) determine compliance with a minimum requirement for eligible own funds and liabilities (MREL) to enable banks to have a sufficient loss-absorbing and recapitalisation capacity in order not to put the application of bail-ins or other resolution instruments at risk and ensure the continuity of their critical functions without representing an additional burden on taxpayers.

The target level to be complied with is decided by the resolution authority in the form of the single resolution board (SRB) on a case-by-case basis for each bank based, inter alia, on its characteristics, notably complexity, risk profile and resolution strategy. As the methodology used to calculate the requirement is applied on the basis of the legislation and the SRB's MREL policy, considering the balance sheet information at a given reference date (usually December 31), the stipulated requirement is therefore subject to review over time (generally on an annual basis).

# MREL decision 

Starting January 1, 2022, CGD was required to comply with the interim MREL requirement, defined in accordance with the SRB's decision in force at that date, under which CGD was required to have:

- a 19.63\% total risk-weighted assets ratio, plus a combined own funds buffer requirement of $3.5 \%$, comprising a total requirement of $23.13 \%$;
- a total leverage ratio exposure of $6.00 \%$.

On January 1, 2022, CGD complied with the binding interim requirement in presenting eligible MREL instruments for its RWAs of $24.58 \%$ and $8.84 \%$ for its leverage ratio exposure (LRE).

The Bank of Portugal announced its binding MREL decision in March 2022, revoking and substituting the former decision and determining compliance with the following MREL requirements, starting January 1, 2024:

- a $22.45 \%$ total risk-weighted assets ratio plus a combined own funds buffer requirement of $3.5 \%$ comprising a total requirement of $25.95 \%$;
- a total leverage ratio exposure of $5.94 \%$.

In March 2023, CGD was notified regarding the new binding MREL Decision determined by the CUR, which revokes and replaces the one received in 2022, establishing compliance with the following MREL requirements, as of 1 January 2024:

- $22,94 \%$ of total risk-weighted assets, plus a combined Own Funds reserve requirement of $3.5 \%$, corresponding to a total requirement of $26.44 \%$;
- $6,27 \%$ of total leverage ratio exposure.

The requirements apply, on a consolidated basis, to the resolution perimeter established by the SRB (prudential banking union perimeter entities, including branches abroad (not having their own legal personality)). The preferred resolution strategy is the MPE (multiple point-of-entry) approach. According to the decision in force at the time, CGD is not obligated to comply with any minimum subordination requirement.

At December 31, 2022, CGD was in compliance with the SRB's binding final requirement in accordance with the decision in force at the time, in achieving the following ratios:

|  | $31-12-2022$ |
| :-- | :--: |
| Own funds and eligible liabilities as \% of RWA (MREL \% RWA) | $27.82 \%$ |
| Own funds and eligible liabilities as \% of LRE (MREL \% LRE) | $9.97 \%$ |

To ensure compliance with MREL requirements, CGD implemented a funding plan, to allow gradual convergence with the requirement set for January 2024.

The first stage of this funding plan was implemented in 2019, with a senior non-preferred debt issuance of $€ 500,000$ thousand. This was the first such issuance of this type of debt by a Portuguese bank.

Caixa also realised a senior preferred debt issuance of $€ 500,000$ thousand in 2021, with a maturity of 6 years and possibility of early redemption after 5 years at a coupon rate of $0.375 \%$. This was the lowest ever achieved by Caixa in its capital market issuances. This issuance has the particularity of being sustainable (environment, social and governance bonds) and targets fund-taking operations to fund the credit operations of its customers in the environmental domain and for socio-economic development purposes. This is the first issuance with these characteristics ever made by a Portuguese bank and is an important milestone in Caixa's implementation of its commitments in the field of sustainable financing, creating value for its customers and reducing the environmental impact of its activity.

Lastly, in 2022, CGD realised another three issuances for a total amount of $€ 834,037$ thousand to meet requirements. In June 2022, CGD launched a "Green" or senior preferred debt issuance for the amount of $€ 300,000$ thousand, with a maturity of 4 years and an early redemption option after 3 years at a coupon rate of $2.875 \%$. This was Caixa's first "Green" issuance, i.e. targeting funds to the credit operations of its customers in the environmental domain and, in this case, promoting energy efficiency in financing homes with $\mathrm{A}+, \mathrm{A}$ and B energy certificates.

Caixa realised a new "Green" issuance of $€ 500,000$ thousand, with a maturity of 6 years and the possibility of early redemption after 5 years at a coupon rate of $5.75 \%$ in October. This was Caixa's third issuance with ESG characteristics totalling an amount of $€ 1,334,037$ thousand.

Lastly and also in October 2022, CGD issued a senior preferred bond for the amount of $€ 5,000,000$ thousand yen (around $€ 34,037$ thousand), which was sold to a private investor. The bond had a maturity of 4 years and the possibility of early redemption after 3 years at a coupon rate of $1.3 \%$.

# Distribution of dividends 

As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the ECB adopted a series of measures to ensure that banks would retain their capacity to absorb losses and strengthen their capacity to lend to the economy.

These particularly included initiatives related to dividend distributions which were, in the first stage, intended to ensure greater retention of the profit made by banks, with the publication on March 27, 2020 of recommendation ECB/2020/19, ruling that, up until October 1, 2020, no dividends should be paid, no irrevocable commitments to pay dividends should be taken by credit institutions and that credit institutions should refrain from share buy-backs aimed at remunerating their shareholders.

The ECB therefore considered the following two situations:
a) To maintain the initial dividend distribution proposal, but conditioning effective payment to a reassessment of the situation when the uncertainties caused by Covid-19 have disappeared (in any event not prior to October 1, 2020);

b) To propose a change in the dividends policy pursuant to which no dividend will be distributed for 2019, committing to a possible distribution of reserves subject to a reassessment of the situation once the uncertainties caused by Covid-19 have disappeared (in any event not prior to October 1, 2020).

In conformity with these guidelines, the shareholders' meeting approved the non-distribution of dividends for 2019, with net profit being appropriated to free reserves, following deduction of the legal reserve (option b of the ECB recommendation).

These restrictive recommendations related to dividend distributions were successively extended on July 27, 2020 by recommendation ECB/2020/35 and on December 15, 2020 by recommendation ECB/2020/62 although this latter recommendation admitted the possibility of dividend distributions or share buy-backs, subject to compliance with the lower of the following two limits: $15 \%$ of respective accrued profit for the 2019 and 2020 financial years or 20 basis points in terms of the CET 1 ratio.

As regards recommendation ECB/2020/62 and the internal dividends distribution policy, CGD paid an amount of $€ 83,639$ thousand to its shareholder, following the approval of its general meeting of May 31, 2021, deferring the possibility of resuming the distributions to a later date as defined in its policy in light of the evolution of the ECB's position.

With the publication of recommendation ECB/2021/31 of July 23, 2021 and based on the latest macroeconomic projections available at the time (indicating the start of economic recovery and a further reduction in the level of economic uncertainty) the ECB decided not to extend the recommendation on dividend distributions after September 2021, while strengthening guidelines that banks should continue to adopt a prudent approach in their decisions on dividends and share buy-backs, giving careful consideration to the sustainability of their business models. They should also not underestimate the risk to capital deriving from additional losses that may be incurred when economic support measures begin to expire.

Accordingly, in November 2021, CGD distributed €300,000 thousand in dividends retained in 2019 and 2020, by paying its shareholder an amount of $€ 383,639$ thousand in 2021 available in "Other reserves and retained earnings" under articles 31 to 33 of the commercial companies code.

On May 31, 2022, the board of directors decided at a general meeting on the appropriation of profit of approximately $€ 570,449$ thousand in 2021 for the distribution of dividends of around $€ 241,071$ thousand (maximum amount distributable according to internal policy) and the payment of an additional amount of around $€ 137,160$ thousand from reserves (under the same terms and conditions as the November 2021 resolution referred to in the preceding paragraph).

Between the completion of CGD's recapitalisation and end 2022, a total amount of $€ 961,870$ thousand was paid in dividends to CGD's shareholder.

# Repayment of additional tier 1 (AT 1) instrument 

In March 2017, under the recapitalisation plan agreed between the Portuguese state and the European Commission, CGD issued an instrument eligible as AT1 for the amount of $€ 500,000$ thousand at market rates, for international institutional investors, at a yield of $10.75 \%$.

Its high capitalisation levels place CGD above the European average (according to the EBA dashboard), in terms of CET 1, tier 1 and total ratios.

CGD applied to the ECB, in 2021, for the early redemption of the AT 1 instrument and was authorised by the ECB on January 28, 2022 to make early repayment without the need to substitute the issuance of additional tier 1 own funds, effective March 30, 2022 as the first date contractually provided for exercising the call.

Owing to the high cost of the referred to coupon rate of $10.75 \%$, the early redemption of the AT1 has improved CGD's organic capacity to generate capital.

# 45. Subsequent events 

On 24 February 2023, the Decree-Law 14/2023 was published by the Portuguese Government, transferring all liabilities covered by the Caixa Geral de Depósitos Staff Pension Fund (CGDPF) to Caixa Geral de Aposentações (CGA), extinguishing and liquidating CGDPF and determining that CGD transfer to CGA a financial compensation for the reassigned responsibilities (Note 36).

On 20 March 2023, Caixa Geral de Depósitos registered an increase in share capital of $€ 681,570,760$ euros and the issuance of 136,314,152 new shares, with a nominal unit value of $€ 5$ each, based on an incorporation of reserves deriving from an equal number of conversion rights, issued to the shareholder following Caixa's inclusion in the special regime applicable to deferred tax assets, decided in 2014.

As a result of this conversion, Caixa's share capital has increased from $€ 3,844,143,735$ to $€ 4,525,714,495$, fully owned by the Portuguese state as its sole shareholder.

Following the completion of this first full year of the new 2021-2024 term of office, it is with a sense of duty accomplished that we can point to the intensification of a cycle of growth, sustainability, transformation and strengthening of Caixa's position as a benchmark institution in Portugal, as shown by the results achieved, both financial and in terms of strategic consolidation.

Albeit a centenary institution, Caixa is an increasingly modern and dynamic bank, with well-prepared and high-powered teams, highly qualified, motivated and resilient employees, with a vision of the future and the determination to meet objectives.

We remain committed to providing a quality, inclusive and future-oriented service, with a firm focus on digital transformation, innovating, simplifying, improving agility and flexibility, while also maintaining high social, environmental and governance standards.

The good results achieved in 2022 and the implementation of our ambitious strategic plan in progress have required an additional effort from our teams, who merit a special word of recognition for the commitment and dedication they have shown. Their work has been fundamental to Caixa's success and the satisfaction of our customers and other stakeholders.

As we are dealing with an unstable macroeconomic environment and have seen an increase in the volatility of financial markets, driven by uncertainties related to political developments in various geographies, we will continue to face important challenges. Unhappily we do not, as yet, see a solid and lasting path towards peace in Ukraine and we do not know all of the resulting consequences on our economy and society.

We are conscious of the difficult times we face, but we are also prepared. As a benchmark financial institution, our mission and duty is to support our customers, the economy and society as a whole, keeping our employees motivated and their merit recognised.

Based on the strength of the various financial indicators and the confidence afforded by the recognition of those who judge us, whether customers, supervisors, rating agencies or the different national and international entities that distinguish us in the most diverse ways, we are preparing the future by investing in innovation, technology, cybersecurity and in optimising support processes and commercial dynamics, making our institution more resilient and robust.

Reference should also be made to the change in Caixa's corporate governance model, in line with international best practice, which has improved our efficiency and achieved more effective separation between management and supervisory functions, helping to achieve Caixa's and its stakeholders' objectives and interests.

We are committed to contributing to our country's economic and social development and to the communities in which we operate. We believe that the financial sector has a key role to play in fostering sustainable development, encouraging job creation and reducing inequalities.

We have been recognised as a benchmark operator in all sustainability-related aspects. We have developed several initiatives and partnerships in areas such as financial literacy, social inclusion and environmental protection. We have played a decisive role in financing the energy transition that businesses and people will have to undertake in coming years owing to the greatest challenge that is the maintenance of human life and biodiversity in general on a planet so impacted by climate change and which is so evident today. We are proud to be a responsible bank, committed to the well-being of people and society in general.

2023 will be a challenging year but we will face it with confidence. Personally, I remain committed to creating greater value for our stakeholders and can assure you that Caixa will continue to contribute to a better future and the promotion of best corporate governance practice.

Together, with resilience and a strong sense of responsibility in meeting the challenges we face, we will achieve all of our goals and consolidate Caixa's leading position in the Portuguese financial system.

[^0]
[^0]:    6 In 2019, CGD's sole shareholder, recognizing its leading role in the Portuguese financial sector and the moment of profound change in the financial sector, as well as the adoption of a new model of corporate governance, formulated a new Mission Letter where it determines CGDs goals, and the mission, vision, guidelines and fundamental values for CGD's future.

# Policies and courses of action in the sphere of the defined strategy 

CGD bases the development of its activity on the following guiding principles:

- Sustainability of the business model, ensured by the profitability of operations, coupled with adequate risk management and an encompassing network of financial services;
- Support to the economy, by guiding lending activity to companies, especially by promoting the internationalization and operationalization of lines to support small and medium sized companies;
- Maintenance of CGD's role in providing banking services to individuals, by creating attractive savings solutions and guaranteeing a comprehensive coverage and high quality of service;

- Monitoring technological developments in the financial sector, both at the institution's level, guaranteeing adjustments that allow CGD to keep its competitiveness in a dynamic financial market and to lead digital banking in Portugal, as well as in the relationship with its clients, by financing investment in innovation and technological development of companies;
- Ensuring CGD's international dimension is guided towards the development of business relationships with countries and territories with strong cultural and commercial ties with Portugal and the valuation of CGD's brand;
- Commitment with the principles of social responsibility, sustainable development and respect for stakeholders.


## Objectives and degree of compliance

The year 2022 was marked by the rise in inflation and interest rates, reflected in the substantial improvement in results, in particular the increase in the profitability of deposits and the loan portfolio after a prolonged period of negative rates. The consolidation of CGD's performance was evident in the return on capital (ROE) and efficiency (Cost-to-Income) ratios, supported by levels of efficiency, asset quality and solvency in line with benchmarks for European banking.

In 2022 Caixa continued to implement its 2021-2024 Strategic Plan. Reference should be made to the following initiatives:

- adoption of agile work models, transversal to various areas of the organization and focused on concrete business objectives, with a significant impact on the growth of digital sales of Consumer Credit, which reached a value of around 45\% in December 2022 and the launch of new insurance sales days for retail Customers;
- transversal review of the Customer service models was carried out, reinforcing the monitoring of commercial managers, leveraging the Remote Management Network and launching a dedicated Private Banking unit. These changes were accompanied by new transaction support solutions, boosting its expansion in future years;
- the launch of differentiated campaigns aimed at the segment of small and medium-sized companies (SMEs), differentiated campaigns were launched, in terms of product and price, using advanced analytics models and a commitment to automating credit decisions for more massmarket and standardized products;
- As a reference bank in ESG practices, initiatives were reinforced to promote equality, diversity and financial and digital inclusion through several initiatives for sustainable and inclusive financing, namely in the development of financial products and services to support households and companies in the energy transition, efficient buildings and sustainable mobility; the importance of the ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance, in English) rating in the credit granting process and approach to customers was reinforced and inclusive digital solutions such as the Caixa digital assistant were developed.

In 2022 Caixa also ensured the execution of its funding strategy, guaranteeing compliance with the necessary capitalisation levels in accordance with MREL requirements. 2022 therefore witnessed the launch of two new green bond issues following the inaugural issue of a sustainable bond in 2021.

# Key factors upon which the company's results depend 

Caixa Group's results were strongly influenced by external and conjunctural factors, of which we highlight those that manifested themselves as from 2022:

- The increased inflation and interest rates with an impact of reduction in household disposable income and, consequently, in consumption, as well as a lower demand for credit. On the other hand, the increase in interest rates had a positive effect on the evolution of the net interest income, and consequently on the Bank's results.
- The increase in household funding costs will placing increased pressure on the risk of non performing loans, as well as an increase in customers with lower credit quality.
- The increased pressure on production costs, the reduction in private consumption and customers payment difficulties leading to additional pressure on companies' treasury, leading to an increase in risk and the need to manage any defaults in a timely manner.
- The impact of new legal measures restrictive of commissioning and which imply constraints on banking activity, an example of which was the suspension of the commission for early repayment of mortgage credit.
- Risk management to prevent cyber-threats, aligned with the business needs and with the necessary dynamism to ensure its evolution. To this end, CGD has defined and implemented its Global Information Security Policy, in order to preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information and maintain the trust of stakeholders.
- Renewal of CGD's corporate culture, with emphasis on talent development and retention, mobilizing and committing the entire organization by promoting innovation, agility and transformation, while maintaining high standards of professionalism, integrity and transparency.

# Membership in associations and participation in foundations 

The Culturgest foundation, created in 2008, is a private foundation with the objective of performing cultural, artistic and scientific activities. The foundation's assets comprised an initial endowment of $€ 3.5$ millions from its founder Caixa Geral de Depósitos, S.A. which also provided its installations and makes an annual endowment which, in 2022, was 2,887,801.59 euros.
![img-48.jpeg](img-48.jpeg)

Since opening its doors, the Foundation has played a significant role in developing the artistic environment in city of Lisbon and country. It has accompanied the careers of directors and choreographers, creating new productions and presenting them to a diverse audience, has commissioned works from visual artists, sponsoring solo and group exhibitions, organising all kinds of music concerts and supporting and hosting the city's major film festivals.

Caixa reinforced its investment in culture, across 2022, in its launch of innovative programmes and continuation or increased investment in already consolidated investments. These programmes were complemented by conferences and debates and a diversified range of workshops, guided tours, meetings and shows for schools and families to serve the community in which it operates.

As the designated manager of the CGD collection, the Caixa Geral de Depósitos Foundation - Culturgest is also responsible for its procurement policy and the judicious implementation thereof having made several acquisitions of relevance across the year.

The Culturgest foundation was given "public utility" status in 2010. This status was based on the merit of its not-for-profit activities and has been successively renewed, the last one already in 2023.

The not-for-profit entities of which CGD is an associate member are listed in annex IV.

## Holdings of Board of Directors and Audit Committee members

The members of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee and related entities do not hold bonds issued by CGD or other CGD Group companies and do not have any investment in companies in which CGD, either directly or indirectly, has a majority shareholding.

The executive members of the Board of Directors who held office during the 2017-2020 term, as well as one of the current non-executive members who held office as executive member at the time, hold commercial paper issued by Caixa, relating to variable remuneration for the years 2018 and 2020, paid in kind in 2022. In chapter 3.7.5. Disclosure of Remuneration, the values of the referred remuneration are detailed.

It should also be noted that the executive members Madalena Rocheta de Carvalho Talone and Maria Manuela Martins Ferreira, and her spouse, also hold commercial paper relating to variable remuneration awarded in previous years when they took office as as managers in Caixa Geral de Depósitos.

In compliance with the Article 447 of the Commercial Companies Code, Annex V of this Corporate Governance Report details the holdings (CGD shares and bonds) held by members of the Board of Directors and Audit Committee, and their spouses and minor descendants.

In 2022 and on 15 different occasions, Fidelidade - Companhia de Seguros, S.A. ("Fidelidade") informed CGD that it had acquired or sold debt securities issued by it. As CGD has a minority shareholding in Fidelidade and that, until March 31, 2022, 2 board members and, after that date, 3 board members held office in both entities, the respective information disclosure requirements were complied with through the CMVM's system for the disclosure of information.

As all of the shares comprising its equity capital, including those to be issued in future capital increases, belong to the Portuguese state and are held by the Directorate-General of the Treasury, all shareholder resolutions are, owing to the nature of the ownership of the equity capital, taken unanimously.

CGD's activity is regulated by the dispositions set out in law and its articles of association which comply with the CSC (commercial companies code) and RGICSF (general credit institutions and financial corporations' regime). Any plans to amend the articles of association must be duly circumstantiated and approved by the shareholder in addition to having been authorised in advance by the supervisory authorities based on the issues to be amended.

## Governance model

The governance model adopted by CGD corresponds to the "dualist" or "Anglo-Saxon" model structured in accordance with the dispositions of articles 278, no. 1 b) and 423-B of the CSC and article 3 of the RUSA. CGD's governance structure includes a Board of Directors and, in terms of supervision, an Audit Committee and an Statutory Audit Company.

In terms of its governance model, CGD's Board of Directors has been provided with the broadest range of powers to manage and represent the company, to include the effective issuance of guidelines on its activity, with the Executive Committee having responsibility for day-to-day management, under the delegation of authority approved at a meeting of CGD's management body. With the election and entry into office of the management body of Caixa Geral de Depósitos, S.A. for the 2021-2024 mandate, the Board of Directors approved, on January 10, 2022, new instrument for the delegation of authority.

The division of responsibilities allows effective separation between supervisory and management functions with the added benefit of constant and extensive supervision, in furthering the objectives and interests of the company, its shareholder, employees, customers and other stakeholders, enabling a level of trust, transparency and balance to be accordingly achieved across the various functions, necessary for their proper operation and effectiveness.

## Term of office of the management and supervisory body

According to CGD's Articles of Association, members of CGD's Board of Directors are elected under a shareholders' resolution for a period of 4 (four) years and may be re-elected, replaced or nominated coopted at the behest of the supervisory boby, in the event of the definitive absence of a board member. A cooption must be ratified by the first shareholders' meeting to be held after the co-option. A co-opted board member shall remain in office up to the end of the current term of office. Members of the Board of Directors, in addition to members of the supervisory body may, in any event, only take up their duties after being subject to the suitability assessment mechanisms provided for in the RGICSF.

In statutory terms, the number of terms of office successively undertaken by members of the Board of Directors is limited to 4 (four), with the terms of office of members of the Audit Committee and the Statutory Audit Company being subject to the dispositions set out in law. Upon coming to the end of their respective terms of office, members of statutory bodies shall remain in place until new officeholders have been elected, without prejudice to the requirements and limits set out in law. The terms of office of the various statutory bodies are not necessarily coincident.

Management's supervisory activity, monitoring of CGD's compliance with the law and its articles of association, verification and oversight of the independence of the Statutory Audit Company in legal terms and, in particular, verification of the suitability and approval of the provision of other services, in addition to audit services, are now the responsibility of the audit committee.

The Statutory Audit Company is appointed by the general meeting on the basis of a proposal of the Audit Committee.

The company Ernst \& Young Audit \& Associados, SROC, S.A, was elected to perform CGD's inspection/audit functions for the 2021-2024 term of office in the form of a unanimous written resolution of 31 May 2021.

The composition of the Board of Directors shall reflect the knowledge, skills and experience necessary to fulfil its obligations, as set out in the suitability assessment policy for the selection of management and supervisory bodies, key function holders and managers of branches abroad and in the succession plan. This implies, in collective terms, that the management body should have a suitable understanding of the areas for which its members are collectively responsible, in addition to having the skills to effectively manage and supervise the institution. As regards the diversity of the Board of Directors, CGD is firmly committed to greater diversity of gender and parity in its composition which should achieve balance between knowledge, capacities, qualifications and professional experience. CGD complies with the dictates of law 62/2017 as regards the objectives and goals of achieving balanced representation between women and men in management and supervisory bodies, having, in 2019, approved CGD Group's diversity policy for its employees and members of its management and supervisory bodies, which defines and establishes acrossthe-board diversity principles applicable to its employees, including members of its statutory bodies.

The suitability of members of the management body is subject to an initial assessment and annual reassessment and upon the occurrence of any supervenient events and is the responsibility of the appointments, assessment and remuneration committee.

Annex II: "Distribution of remits of members of the executive committee" provides information on the distribution of such areas among executive committee members in 2022.

## Executive boards and committees

CGD currently has 10 executive boards and 5 committees, in which the former are decision-making bodies that consider and decide upon proposals submitted by the executive committee and the latter are structures which report to the executive committee but which do not have any decision-making authority and which prioritise discussion and advisory support to the decision-making process.

The evolution of boards to which the executive committee has delegated authority, remains positive, particularly as regards the flexibility and efficiency of the adopted model, which has allowed for in-depth discussions on the issues, disclosure of information relevant to informed decision-making and the dissemination of relevant guidance on various matters.

The current management model regulating the intervention of governance bodies allows effective support to be provided to the management and governance of CGD and CGD group, in a context of increasing regulatory requirements in terms of supervision, business, and market. In such a context, reference should be made to the revision of current regulation, which particularly includes the creation of the IT development executive board (CDDI) as a forum for definitions of and decisions on strategic priorities for information systems and technologies and strengthening the liaison existing between boards and between them and the executive committee, fostering proximity with structural bodies. The composition of these forums was also changed, with regard to the required attendance of executive members and senior officials which has made it possible to improve the model's efficiency and strengthen the participation, accountability and commitment of the various parties involved.

The flexibility of the group's current management model permits the creation of forums for discussion and advisory support for decision-making in response to the challenges being faced by CGD owing to the current context, such as the Covid risk committee and its transition to the Ukraine crisis committee.

In the committees domain, adjustments were made to the structure to meet the new challenges of improving efficiency, in line with the strategic plans of the control and governance functions.

The scope of performance and activity of the executive boards in 2022 were as follows:

The transposition of this policy by CGD's subsidiaries where it enjoys majority ownership, is concluded.

CNAR is responsible for assisting and advising the Board of Directors on its choice of employees to be appointed as key function holders.

The assessment of the adequacy of the people qualified to be designated, by the Board of Directors, as Key Function Holders, is the responsibility of CNAR, upon proposal by the Executive Committee.

The Board of Directors is responsible for reassessing the adequacy, whether annual or specific, of the key function holders of CGD, based on a previous opinion by CNAR and has been carried out on a yearly basis. It is also the responsibility of CNAR to support and advise the Board of Directors in defining, approving and assessing the application of mechanisms that ensure an effective process for selecting and assessing the adequacy of the key function holders.

# 3.5.2.3. Supervision 

On 23 December 2021, with the entry into force of Caixa's new "dualistic" or "Anglo-Saxon" governance model, structured in accordance with the provisions of articles 278, no. 1 b) and 423 B of the commercial companies code and article 3 of the RJSA (legal regulations governing audit supervision) - Caixa's supervisory function is now the responsibility of an audit committee and a statutory audit company (SROC), with the supervisory board having been extinguished.

Therefore, across 2021, within the framework of CGD's governance bodies' transition process, the supervisory board initiated several handover activities to the new supervisory body in the form of the audit committee, comprising letters identifying the most relevant aspects of CGD's supervisory activity and the

transition process of the supervisory bodies. With the direct involvement of the previous supervisory board and audit and control committee as a special board of directors committee to which the internal audit function reported, the following actions were also taken: (i) production of proposals for the audit committee regulation and the activities plan and RACI matrix for 2022, latterly approved by the audit committee; (ii) a systemised follow up of issues carried forward from the audit and control committee and supervisory board; and (iii) definition of proposals for procedures to streamline the audit committee's operating model.

# Audit committee 

## Composition

CGD's audit committee for the 2021-2024 term of office comprises 4 (four) permanent members, appointed by the company's general meeting, in the form of a unanimously approved corporate resolution set out in writing, chosen from among the non-executive members of the board of directors. The number of members of the audit board is adequate and sufficient, particularly taking into account Caixa's structure and size together with the complexity of the risks inherent to its activity.

Most of the audit committee members are independents, including their chairman, in accordance with current legislation, Caixa's articles of association and audit committee regulation. They have, as a whole, the appropriate skills, qualifications and professional experience for the performance of their duties, in particular a high level of competence and knowledge of the financial, accounting and audit areas, in addition to past training and experience in banking and finance activity.

The suitability of members of the supervisory body was subject to an initial assessment and an annual reassessment and always upon the occurrence of any supervenient events and is the responsibility of the appointments, assessment and remuneration committee.

# Policy and rotation period of the External Auditor and respective partner 

In accordance with no. 2 of article 54 of law 140/2015 of 7 September, in public interest entities the maximum period for performing statutory audit functions by the partner responsible for the guidelines on or direct performance of the statutory audit is 7 years, starting from the time of first appointment, with the possibility of a new appointment being made after a minimum period of 3 years has elapsed.

As referred to in no. 3 of article 54 of the above referred to law, in the case of public interest entities, the minimum initial period for the performance of statutory audit functions by the statutory auditor or Statutory Audit Company is 2 years, with a maximum duration of 10 years.

For the purposes of no. 2 and 3 of article 54 of Law no. 140/2015 of 7 September, the counting of deadlines are calculated from the first financial year covered by the contractual relationship by which the statutory auditor or company of statutory auditors was first appointed to carry out consecutive statutory audits of the same public interest entity.

## Body responsible for assessing the provision of services by the Statutory Audit Company/external auditor

As provided for in article 420 of the commercial companies code and article 30 of CGD's articles of association, the Audit Committee is, inter alia, responsible for examining the review of the accounts and the auditing of the company's accounting documents and assessing the independence of auditor as regards the provision of additional services and submitting a proposal on the nomination of the Statutory Audit Company to the shareholders' meeting.

It should be noted that as a result of the statutory amendment carried out by means of a unanimous written resolution of 25 January 2021, under the terms of articles 8 and 28 of the Articles of Association, the Company's supervisory body is composed of the Statutory Auditor and the Audit Committee whose members are part of the Board of Directors. On December 21, 2021, the members of the Audit Committee were appointed.

Under subparagraphs d) and e) of paragraph 3 of article 3 of Law $n^{\circ}$ 148/2015, the supervisory body is responsible for verifying and monitoring the independence of the SROC, as well as the legal review of the individual and consolidated annual accounts and other services provided within the scope of the attributions conferred to the SROC.

In this context, the supervisory body regularly meets with the Statutory Auditor and the head of the External Audit team to monitor its activity, namely through a critical analysis of the work plan prepared by the Audit for the year under analysis, as well as in the clarification of doubts and survey of topics that eventually you want to be more scrutinized in the process of preparing the accounts or of another nature. Prior to the issuance of the Legal Certification of Accounts, Audit Committee receives from the Statutory Auditor a report called the Additional Report to the Supervisory Body, which summarizes the most relevant topics for the year's audit.

# Internal procedures for the approval of Non-Audit Services 

In addition to the audit work/legal review of the accounts, in 2022 the Auditor provided the following different audit services, related to audit services or classified as assurance services:

- A review limited to the separate and consolidated half-yearly financial statements of CGD/CGD Group;
- A review of the annual sustainability report;
- Services required for reporting purposes to the Bank of Portugal, CMVM (Securities Market Commission) and other regulators of the CGD Group's foreign entities;
- Agreed procedural services for reporting to the Audit Committee as part of this bodies' reports to the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Portugal;;
- Other services to support the issuance of: i) reports in accordance with existing legislation and regulations on covered bonds; ii) comfort letters for the renewal of the EMTN (Euro Medium Term Notes) programme and public issuances under this programme and services to be provided under the TLTRO (targeted longer-term refinancing operations).

In accordance with the provisions of article 4 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of April 16, 2014, the statutory auditor who provides services other than auditing not prohibited by law of the European Union organizes a file containing:
a) The approval of the referred services and the respective grounds by the relevant supervisory bodies;
b) The contracts concluded;
c) Documentation supporting the work carried out and the conclusions reached; and the
d) Final result delivered to the audited entity or its parent company or entities under its control, as applicable.

If the services referred to in the previous number are provided by entities, based in Portugal, of the network to which the statutory auditor belongs, the statutory auditor guarantees that the latter organizes a file that complies with the provisions of the previous number.

Caixa Serviços Partilhados ("CSP") has an aggregating function for the goods and services purchasing process of its group companies and is involved both upstream, at the negotiating phase of the contracts for the supply of goods and services, managing the contracts and the assets' means of logistical support.

To control the approval process and examination of compliance with independence requirements, the Statutory Audit Company and CSP keep an up-to-date list of all requests submitted with the respective documentation and the state of the approval process being annexed thereto and submitted to CAC and the Audit Committee by the Statutory Audit Company, upon request. This information is also used to control the cap on the fees since the $4^{\text {th }}$ year of the mandate.

Reference should be made to the fact that the updated rules of the IESBA's (International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants) code of ethics came into force on 15 December 2022. Owing to the rules governing independence and procedures currently in force for audited EU PIEs (Public interest entities) the main impacts thereof were related to the need to update the pre-approval procedures for non-audit services agreed with the supervisory bodies, complementing them with a general pre-concurrence policy.

The concept of pre-concurrence is different from the concept of approval/pre-approval existing for EU PIEs, as assessing the permissibility of the provision of non-audit services in accordance with the independence requirements of the IESBA's code of ethics, is exclusively the responsibility of the auditor of the PIE. An assessment of the individualised independence of the public interest entity is not required of the supervisory boards.

In addition, the scope of territorial application is different from the existing requirements for EU PIEs, and requires pre-concurrence for the non-audit services provided to the ascendant and descendant entities of the IESBA PIE, no matter where they are based/domiciled (i.e. outside the EU).

# Policy for the selection and appointment of the statutory auditors and agreements for the provision of non-prohibited, non-audit services 

CGD has updated its policy on the selection and appointment of its statutory auditor and agreement for nonprohibited, non-audit services. The changes made were based on the report prepared by DAI (RAI 0001-01-2021-130 - Policy and agreement for the selection and appointment of the statutory auditors) dated 19 January 2021 and based on the JST's guidelines which were sent to CGD on 15 April 2021 (DGUDI/2021/0260 - ECB's feedback on CGD's policy for selecting and appointing the statutory auditors).

The most recent version of the policy was published on 31 May 2022 and prior to the publication and disclosure thereof followed the following approval process as described in article 38. no. 1 and article 38 no. 2 of notice $3 / 2020$ :

- CAUD on 28 March 2022, decided in favour of the approval of the policy review proposal by CGD's shareholder;
- The board of directors on 05 April 2022, considered and approved the proposal for the revision of the policy after due consideration given that the proposed review was assessed favourably by CAUD;
- On 06 May 2022, in reply to the letter sent by JST the updated policy incorporating the opportunities for improvement identified by JST and the contributions received from the compliance and internal audit divisions was sent. JST generally considered that this new version of the policy adopts a broad-brush approach to the opportunities for improvement identified.
- The general meeting of 31 May 2022 decided favourably on the main aspects of the proposed review of the policy, namely resulting from legal alterations, changes to the governance model adopted by CGD and the recommendations of the internal audit and the supervisor.

In essence, the policy regulates the process for the selection and designation of the statutory auditor and includes a description of the stages and procedures to be complied with, selection criteria and respective weighting, procedures and initiatives to be carried out by the supervisory body for the purposes of overseeing and verifying the services provided by the statutory auditor and the monitoring of its independence, the ways in which the supervisory body intervenes in the process of contracting for distinct audit services which have not been prohibited, the process involving the frequency of training actions by CGD's directors involved in the statutory auditor selection processes and the definition of the structural bodies involved in the implementation of the policy, revision of the regulations and disclosure thereof.

### 3.5.2.4. Company secretary

Under the terms of its articles of association, CGD has a permanent and an alternate secretary appointed by the Board of Directors.

The term of office of the permanent and alternate secretaries shall coincide with the term of office of the Board of Directors which has appointed them and may be renewed on one or more occasions.

In addition to the other functions set out in law, the company secretary is responsible for:

- Providing meetings with secretarial services;
- Drawing up and signing the minutes of the meetings together with the members of the respective statutory bodies and the president of the board of the general meeting, as appropriate;

On 31 December 2022, the posts of permanent and alternate secretaries were held, respectively, by Artur Rocha Gouveia and António Miguel Dias Mateus.

# 3.5.3. Prevention of conflicts of interest 

CGD is a fully state-owned company and, as a credit institution, supplies global banking and financial services, of which activity the prevention and management of conflicts of interest is an integral part.

As a credit institution, its organisational and administrative mechanisms are commensurate with the type, scale and complexity of its activity and enable the effective identification of possible conflicts of interest, the adoption of adequate measures to avoid or reduce the risk of the occurrence thereof to a minimum and the adoption of reasonable measures to prevent the interests of its customers from being prejudiced following the detection of a situation involving a conflict of interest.

CGD is regulated, herein, by domestic standards, namely the RGICSF (General Credit Institutions and Financial Corporations Regime), CdVM (Securities Market Commission) RJSPE (Legal Regime Regulating the State's Corporate Sector) and CSC (Commercial Companies Code), in addition to the standards and guidelines issued by European institutions and domestic (where Bank of Portugal Notice 3/2020 stands out) and international supervisory authorities.

Particular reference should be made, in respect of members of statutory bodies, to the internal governance guidelines issued by the European Banking Authority (EBA/GL/2021/05 of 02/07/2021), joint EBA and ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) guidelines on the suitability of members of boards of management and key function holders (EBA/GL/2021/06 of 02/07/2021 and ESMA35-36-2319), guidelines for assessments of the suitability and good standing of members of the management bodies of the European Central Bank and Bank of Portugal Instruction 23/2018, on authorisation for holding office as members of the boards of management and supervisory boards of institutions subject to the supervision of the Bank of Portugal and European Central Bank in the sphere of the Single Supervisory Mechanism.

Particular reference should be made to CGD's following internal standards which are binding upon all employees including members of statutory bodies:

- CGD's Code of Conduct, published on its website defines operating principles ("Independence of Interests") and standards of professional conduct ("Conflicts of Interest") on situations involving conflicts of interest which may occur during the performance of its activity.
- CGD, S.A.'s individual and corporate Global Prevention and Management of Conflicts of Interest Policy (Global Policy), as published in its internal standards system;
- The Policy for assessing suitability for selection as members of management and supervisory boards and key function holders (Suitability Policy), published on CGD's website;
- Internal standards on the prevention of conflicts of interest on an institutional level, such as conflicts relating to prohibitions and limitations on loans to members of statutory bodies, prevention of market abuse, subcontracting, decision-making competencies for credit and similar operations, approval and monitoring of products and performance of internal control functions (all of which have been published in CGD's internal standards system);
- CGD's Policy for Transactions with Related Parties, published in the system of internal rules and on CGD's institutional website, which defines the criteria and procedures to be observed in the analysis of transactions with Related Parties.
- CGD's internal rules on the Acceptance or Offer of Gifts and Hospitality establish the principles of action and rules of professional conduct to be observed by employees when, in the exercise of their activities and functions, they are confronted with the possibility of accepting or offering gifts and other advantages, namely hospitality.

Members of management and supervisory bodies perform their duties in the interest of Caixa Geral de Depósitos, in due compliance with principles of transparency and loyalty.

The identification, prevention and management of conflicts of interest or potential conflicts of interest ensure that duties will be performed with an independence of spirit.

In particular, members of boards of management and supervisory boards are fully aware that they cannot intervene in the consideration and decision-making process in which they themselves, their spouse or person with whom they live in a de facto union, relative or the like up to the 1st degree are directly or indirectly involved or companies or other collective entities any of which they directly or indirectly control, under the terms of articles 85 and 86 of the RGICSF. Article 410, $\mathrm{n}^{2}$. 6 of the Commercial Companies Code also states

that directors shall not vote on matters in which, for their own account or on behalf of a third party, they have an interest in conflict with that of the company.

The existence of situations which generate conflicts of interest or with the potential to do so, when involving members of management and supervisory bodies is verified under CGD's assessment process and the ECB's authorisation for the performance of office of members of the Board of Directors or the supervisory body on a permanent basis and at least once a year, which takes place through reassessing the adequacy as previously described. The Global Policy characterises situations involving conflicts or potential conflicts of interest, establishes materiality thresholds and lists the mitigation measures. The mechanisms and procedures for reporting and registering the situations identified as well as the instances to consider and decide upon the matter are also provided for therein.

In the event that there is any situation of conflict or potential conflict of interest during the exercise of the position of member of the Board of Directors that does not determine consequences expressly provided for by law, the following is applied:

- Of the Board of Directors as a whole and without the participation of the member involved in a conflict of interest situation, to assess the situation and approve the proposed actions on the basis of an analysis and the advance opinion of the Compliance Division (DC) in order for the situation to be settled or mitigated, which decisions may be reviewed and revoked by the supervisory body;

The Compliance Division referred to analysis and advance opinion are sent to CNAR, to the Risk Committee (CR), to the Governance Committee (CG) and the Audit and Control Committee (CAC) to be taken into account in the assessment of situations of conflicts of interest for which these committees are responsible and which may request Compliance Division to take additional steps.

- Of CNAR, as a whole, without the participation of the member involved in a conflict of interest situation, if a member thereof, assisted by Compliance Division, to assess whether the situation could compromise the independence and performance of the members of the Board of Directors and to inform the supervisory body of all situations in which it concludes that the conflict may compromise the independence and performance of the member of the Board of Directors.
- Of CR to take notice of situations and ask for any additional clarifications it deems necessary in the exercise of its role as a support committee for the Board of Directors in terms of risks, namely Compliance risks;
- Of CG, as a whole and without the participation of the member involved in a conflict of interest situation, if a member thereof, to assess the impact of the conflict of interest on Caixa's governance and inform the Board of Directors of its conclusions and also include its analysis in the annual report advising the Board of Directors on the matter;
- Of the Supervisory Body, to take note of the situations and ask for additional clarifications it considers appropriate to its duties as an advisory committee to the Board of Directors on audit and internal control matters.

The occurrence of any conflict of interest involving the chairman of the Board of Directors must be reported to the chairman of the supervisory body, which body should, as a whole, assess the conflict and establish the proceedings to be adopted to settle or mitigate it.

The supervisory body shall inform the Joint Supervisory Team of the Single Supervisory Mechanism and advise the shareholder on all situations of conflicts of interest involving members of the Board of Directors when it concludes that the mitigation measures are insufficient or that the conflict could compromise the independence and performance of the member of the Board of Directors.

In the event that there is any situation of conflict or potential conflict of interests during the exercise of the position of member of the supervisory body that does not determine consequences expressly provided for by law, it is the responsibility:

- Of the supervisory body, as a whole and without the participation of the member involved in a conflict of interest situation, to assess the situation and approve the proposed actions, based on the analysis and advance approval of Compliance Division (which is also sent to CNAR), for the resolution or mitigation thereof;

- Of CNAR, as a whole and without the participation of the member involved in a conflict of interest situation, if a member thereof, and with the support of Compliance Division, to assess whether the situation could compromise the independence and the performance of the member of the supervisory body and to also include its conclusions in the annual assessment of the suitability of each member of the supervisory body.

CNAR shall inform the chairman of the supervisory body and the chairman of the Board of Directors of all situations in which it concludes that the conflict could compromise the independence and the performance of the member of the supervisory body. The occurrence of a situation of a conflict of interest involving a member of the supervisory body upon which adequate mitigation measures have not been taken, must be immediately reported to the ECB and the shareholder informed thereof.

In the event of the occurrence of a conflict of interest involving the president of the supervisory body, it should be made known to the other members of that supervisory body, who assisted by Compliance Division, are responsible for assessing the conflict and establishing the procedures to be adopted for the purpose of resolving or mitigating the conflict.

There are no record of familiar, professional or commercial relationships between the members of the management and oversight bodies and the shareholder.

# 3.5.4. Lending to members of management and supervisory bodies 

The policies on prohibitions and restrictions on lending to members of CGD's management and supervisory bodies, as set out in article 85 (lending to members of management and supervisory boards) of the RGICSF have been set out in an internal CGD regulation which defines the respective rules and procedures to be adopted herein.

The referred to regulation establishes credit institutions limitations on lending to members of their management or supervisory bodies or to companies or other collective entities directly or indirectly controlled by them.

Lending is presumed to be indirect when the beneficiary is a spouse or a person living in a de facto union, a relation or the like up to the first degree of any member of the management or supervisory boards of a company directly or indirectly controlled by any of the said persons.

Requests in opposition to the above referred to presumption should be formulated prior to the issue of the loan, which should be considered by CGD's Board of Directors which, if accepting the counter argument, shall inform the Bank of Portugal with a minimum advance notice of thirty days prior to the concrete act of making the loan.

The above referred to prohibition does not include the following lending operations:

- a social character or purpose or when deriving from CGD's employee policy, in addition to loans resulting from the use of credit cards, according to conditions which are similar to those practiced with other customers with a similar profile and risk;
- when the beneficiaries are credit institutions, financial corporations or holding companies which are included in the consolidated supervision perimeter to which CGD is subject, nor pension fund management companies, insurance companies, brokers and other insurance mediators which control or are controlled by any other entity in the same supervision perimeter.

Members of the management or supervisory body may not participate in the assessment and decision of credit granting operations that directly or indirectly concern them or that benefit companies or other collective entities of which they are managers, including entities of the CGD Group, or in which they hold qualifying holdings, requiring in all these situations the approval by a majority of at least two thirds of the remaining members of the management body and the favorable opinion of the supervisory body.

CGD internally defined and formalized policies, rules and procedures related to the prohibitions defined under article 85 of the RGICSF, and in this context, the Internal Audit Department (DAI) is responsible, at the beginning of each term of office of CGD's management or supervisory boards and then annually, for validating the information provided by the referred to members with the identification of their respective spouses, or de facto spouses, relatives or the like up to the $1^{\text {st }}$ degree in addition to companies directly or

indirectly controlled by members or by any of the referred to persons, verifying the conformity of the implementation and maintenance of the established control system.

There were no credit operations or the like covered by the reporting obligation of article 85 of the referred to regulation, in 2022.

# 3.6. Internal organisation 

### 3.6.1. Statutes ${ }^{7}$ and communications

## Communication of irregularities

Credit institutions, in conformity with the RGICSF ${ }^{8}$ must implement specific, independent, autonomous means for the reception, treatment and archiving of reports on serious irregularities related to their administration, accounting organisation and internal supervision and serious indications of any infractions of the duties listed in the RGICSF or regulation (EU) no. 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June.

Similarly, under the terms of the international recommendations issued by the EBA (European Banking Authority) and European Commission, banking institutions must adopt internal procedures as an alternative to the usual means of reporting, to allow their workers to report legitimate, significant concerns on matters related to the activity of organisations.

In compliance with these recommendations, under article 37 of its code of conduct, CGD must implement an internal reporting procedure on irregular practice alleged to have occurred in the sphere of its activity, ensuring confidentiality in terms of treatment, in addition to not taking any retaliatory measures against any whistle-blower who has acted in good faith.

This procedure is regulated by the internal standard which establishes the "internal reporting system on irregular practice" (SCIPI) which evaluates their characteristics, the treatment afforded to such communications and the parties involved in the system.

Law 83/2017 of 18 August, which defines anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism measures requires credit institutions to define adequate internal means, providing their workers with access to a specific, independent, anonymous channel to report any violations of the said law and its respective regulation, in addition to any violations of internally defined policies, procedures and controls on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism matters. Under current regulation, a summary of the information on communications dealing with such issues is reported as part of the report on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism.

Similarly, according to the securities code, financial brokers must adopt specific, independent, autonomous means and procedures to enable their workers to report facts, evidence or information on any infractions or irregularities which have already been, are being or which appear likely to be committed, related to the issues defined in the referred to law, namely financial instruments, public securities offerings and organised forms of trading in financial instruments.

Law 93/2021 of 20 December, which came into force at the end of first half 2022, transposes directive (EU) no. 2019/1937 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of whistle-blowers who report violations of Union law, created new rules applicable to systems involving irregular practice, both internally and in the case of public bodies. CGD has made appropriate changes to its policy to comply with these new legislative provisions.

Decree law 109-E/2021 of 7 December also established the "general regulations on the prevention of corruption", reinforcing the need for institutions to implement and regulate their internal systems on irregular practice.

SCIPI may be used for communications on the following matters:
a) Potential or actual violations of CGD's obligations in its pursuit of financial brokerage activities, as set out in regulation (EU) no. 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council;
b) Infractions or irregularities which have already been, are being or which, in light of the available information appear likely to be committed, in respect of the following matters:

- Financial instruments, public securities offerings, organised means of trading in financial instruments, settlement and clearing systems, central counterparties, financial brokerage, loan

# 3.6.2. Internal control and risk management 

## Internal control system

The internal control system is defined as being a set of strategies, policies, processes, systems and procedures aimed at ensuring CGD's sustainability over the medium and long term and prudent performance of its activity as follows:
a) Compliance with strategic planning objectives, efficient conduct of operations, efficient use of institution's resources and safeguarding of its assets;
b) Adequate identification, assessment, monitoring and control of the risks to which CGD is or may be exposed;
c) Existence of complete, pertinent, reliable and timely financial and non-financial information;
d) Adoption of solid accounting procedures;
e) Compliance with legislation, regulations and guidelines applicable to CGD's activity, as issued by the competent authorities, compliance with CGD's own internal regulations, as well as professional and deontological standards and practices and rules of conduct and customer relations.

Bank of Portugal notice 3/2020, published on 15 July, lists the minimum requirements governing the internal control systems of credit institutions and financial corporations and systemises the core principles governing their implementation, adopting internationally recognised and accepted concepts as defined in the "Internal

Control - Integrated Framework", methodology published by the "Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)" and the recommendations issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision through the "Framework for Internal Control Systems in Banking Organisations" and "Internal Governance" guidelines published by the EBA.

Risk management has its own chapter in the annual report, as well as a note in each of the annexes to the separate and consolidated financial statements referred to as "Disclosures on Financial Instruments", describing the financial risk management policies and quantifying CGD and Group's exposure to each type of risk.

Under this framework and to effectively comply with its defined objectives, CGD Group endeavours to guarantee an adequate control environment, a solid risk management system, an efficient information and communication system and a continuous monitoring process with the objective of ensuring the quality and efficacy of the system over time.

To achieve these objectives, specific, transversal responsibilities related with the management of internal control systems have been attributed to certain CGD structural bodies whose hierarchical and/or functional relationships are reflected in the organisational chart below:
![img-53.jpeg](img-53.jpeg)

The governance model adopted in Caixa Geral de Depósitos, S.A., comprises a board of directors, audit committee and statutory auditor and endeavours to promote the institutional and functional relationship between corporate bodies, implementing effective separation between management and supervisory functions.

In March 2020, the chairman of the board of directors and chairman of the executive committee of Caixa Geral de Depósitos, S.A. submitted a proposal to its sole shareholder for a change in its governance model, proposing the extinguishing of the supervisory board and the creation of an audit committee, as part of the board of directors. The proposal was approved in the form of a unanimously approved written corporate resolution of 25 January 2021.

This change was implemented at the time of the election of the board of directors of Caixa Geral de Depósitos, S.A. for the 2021-2024 term of office, in the form of a unanimously approved written corporate resolution of 21 December 2021. With this change, Caixa Geral de Depósitos, S.A. abandoned the classical

governance model and returned to the Anglo-Saxon model, comprising a board of directors, audit committee and statutory auditor ${ }^{9}$. In this model, the audit committee, as a supervisory body, comprises members of the board of directors who do not have executive functions.

In turn, the Risk Management Division's organic structural manual, which was updated in November 2021, aims to expand the scope of this Division's remit as a second line of defence with responsibility for the group's risk management function, overseeing all financial and non-financial risks, to which the group is exposed.

One of the strategic priorities of the "strategic plan on control functions" (PEFC), approved by the board of directors, was to define a new organisational and functional model for the compliance division (DC), internal audit division (DAI) and risk management division (DGR), particularly in terms of their articulation with management and supervisory boards, in order to improve the effectiveness of the 2nd and 3rd lines of defence for risk monitoring purposes and their contribution to enable CGD to implement its strategy in addition to eliminating overlapping areas between control functions to achieve effective complementarity. The new model implemented in DGR is no longer a part of the internal control area (ACI) which was integrated into the rating division (DRT) with the objective of strengthening the focus on risk management responsibilities and ensuring the equidistance of ACI vis-à-vis the three control functions of internal audit, compliance and risk management.

The business continuity, operational risk and internal control executive board (CDCRC) is the executive committee's decision-making body responsible for the coordination, consideration and discussion of matters related to operational risk management and internal control deficiencies on a group-wide level, in addition to matters relating to the monitoring and management of data protection and the monitoring of reputational risk.

Structural decision-making to ensure data protection management, enforcement by top management and empowerment of the data protection officer and data protection office in terms of current management has been delegated to CDCRC.

This board met eleven times, in 2022, for considering and making decisions on data protection matters deriving from the furtherance of banking business, optimisation of internal processes, technological innovations and corporate governance support activities.

The appointment of a data protection officer (DPO) in banking activity is obligatory under the terms of the general data protection regulation (GDPR), owing to the processing operations on the regular and systematic control of customers' data required during the normal course of banking activity.

A corporate-level data protection officer, whose respective functions were defined in harmony and compliance with the provisions of articles 37 to 39 of the GDPR was appointed under an executive committee resolution of 6 December 2017.

The data protection officer is independent and autonomous in the performance of his/her functions and reports directly to the executive committee and chief risk officer. The GDPR requires the function of the data protection officer to involve direct communication with an institution's top management and reference should be made to his/her participation on executive boards, advisory committees and boards defined in CGD's internal regulations, including the data protection governance model.

The data protection officer ensures the coordination of data protection management planning in CGD and the group, controls the conformity of CGD and the group's data processing operations with the applicable legal provisions and policies and internal regulations on data protection, informs and advises the board of directors, top management and structural bodies responsible for the treatment of personal data, including CGD group entities, whenever necessary in liaison with data protection officers (subsidiaries) and data protection pivots (branches).

The data protection officer is responsible for ensuring in situ conformity checks on data protection in CGD and the group, examining and ensuring the control of respective compliance therewith.

The data protection officer heads the data protection office whose exclusive mission is to provide collaboration and institutional assistance in the performance of his/her functions, namely helping to produce the privacy and data protection policy, cookies policy, internal regulations on data protection or connected matters, issue of opinions on data protection in general and data protection impact assessments (DPIAs), in

particular, together with the promotion of banking business (e.g. digital transformation, validation of communications on the marketing of banking products and services, campaigns and events).

ACI, now part of DRT and now referred to as the rating and internal control division (DRT), is responsible for overseeing the internal control model implemented in CGD group. This model established and implemented a robust monitoring process on deficiencies and, in 2020, defined a CGD group internal control deficiencies management policy which was recently revised and approved by the board of directors in August 2022 and transposed into all CGD group entities, with the exception of BCG Brasil and the Timor branch. Special reference should be made in this latter revision to the optimisations of the materiality matrix to be taken into account for the identification and grading of the level of risk involved in the deficiencies, such as opportunities for improvement, in addition to the improvements to the previous review, namely 1) definition and control of service level agreement (SLAs) to resolve deficiencies, depending on their level of severity; 2) reporting and monitoring of internal control deficiencies with regular reporting to management, consentaneous with the risk of unresolved deficiencies; and 3) improving effectiveness and efficiency in resolving deficiencies.

The validation framework for the resolution of deficiencies to be validated by the 2nd line of defence was consolidated, in the context of the defined policy and implementation of the plan, based on very close and constant oversight of the internal control area and chief risk officer.

This policy enables CGD to strengthen its role as the parent company and, in a structured and comprehensive manner, ensures its effective supervision of CGD group entities in order to enforce, monitor, and validate the progress achieved in addressing deficiencies.

CGD therefore only had one critical group risk deficiency at the end of December 2022, achieving progress in resolving such deficiencies, with a $25 \%$ reduction in the number of unresolved deficiencies and a $84 \%$ reduction in the total number of deficiencies of more than 1 year since the end of December 2021.

# Advancement and implementation of the Internal Control System 

The responsibility and sphere of competence of all CGD bodies (commissions, boards, committees and structural bodies) include the following:

- To ensure the existence of an adequate Internal control system and contribute to the effective development and consolidation of an internal control culture, permitting sound and prudent management by CGD and group entities;
- To manage the risks inherent to their respective activities;
- To implement and maintain control procedures and implement corrective or improvement actions to remedy any control deficiencies/weaknesses identified and reported on processes within their scope of intervention.

There are also responsibilities related to the internal control system:

- Listed in the respective regulations as regards CGD bodies;
- Listed in the respective organic structure manuals, with regard to CGD's structural bodies in their functional relationship with CGD group entities and which complement the management of CGD's internal control system as a parent company.


## Control System for the Protection of the Company's Investments and Assets

To comply with the dispositions of the Bank of Portugal in its official notice 3/2020 and instructions n 18/2020 and, on a complementary level, based on the European Banking Authority - EBA's document: "EBA Guidelines on Internal Governance under Directive 2013/36/EU" (EBA/GL/2021/05)". CGD's activity is governed on the basis on a series of guidelines and internal standards as the control system's main supporting instruments for protecting its investments and assets. Such guidelines and internal standards are also the tools upon which the management and control of the financial and non-financial risks assumed by CGD are sustained, as they govern the maximum levels of risk it may incur, in compliance with its risk appetite.

## Company's risk profile

The risk appetite statement formally establishes CGD's risk appetite, defining the maximum risk level the Bank is willing to assume on each risk category considered as being material. The risk strategy is directly

related with the Bank's objectives and Strategic Plan and is regularly reviewed and monitored by the board of directors and management team.

The Risk Appetite Statement is complemented by the respective dissemination to Group units (international and domestic activity) and the Risk Appetite Governance Model (RAF - Risk Appetite Framework) that establishes the governance model and involvement of the Bank's different areas, risk management and monitoring mechanisms and the integration of Risk Appetite in risk management and decision-making processes.

General risk appetite principles are set out in qualitative declarations which define the Group's risk strategy. These principles derive from and are aligned with CGD's business strategy and the understanding of the resulting risk/benefit trade-offs. The principles are part of the Bank's culture and strategy, upon which all of its activities are based.

The Group Risk Appetite is based on three general principles:

- To ensure solvency and liquidity levels - Group should ensure adequate solvency and liquidity levels, observing the following:
- To maintain capital strength based on a regular review of the balance sheets' structure;
- To maintain capital levels at a higher level than required by regulation, ensuring the existence of a buffer in line with market expectations, both in normal as in adverse scenarios;
- To continue to ensure a stable, solid and safe liquidity position able to withstand adverse scenarios;
- To maintain stable levels of financing capacity and an adequate stock of high quality liquid assets based on a market-driven approach enabling the balance sheet structure to be adapted to existing circumstances;
- To control the risk exposure of international entities while, at the same time, maintaining their independence in terms of financing and capital adequacy.
- To ensure long term sustainability and to maintain a leading market position as follows:
- Long term stability based on adequate returns on balance sheet risks, improved operational efficiency and risk management which may put the execution of the Institution's strategy at risk, particularly when associated with credit risk.
- Maintenance of its identity as a commercial Bank and leading position in the Portuguese market, both in deposits and lending to the economy and households, focusing on retail customers and small and medium-sized enterprises;
- The aim of achieving a simple and transparent Group structure, based on a modern infrastructure to ensure adequate customer satisfaction levels and minimise operational risk.
- Long-term sustainability of the business model within the scope of the commitments assumed for carbon neutrality and sustainable development.
- Adopting risk management practices of excellence - Group should ensure the adoption of best risk management practice, observing the following:
- To strengthen governance and Risk Management and Control functions, ensuring that they are on a level of best market practice and therefore helping to merit greater stakeholder trust;
- To operate in accordance with solid risk management principles with an effective governance model and policies which ensure compliance with laws and regulations, guaranteeing full alignment with the European Central Bank's SREP - Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process guidelines (as a transversal supervision methodology structured around: i) an analysis of institutions' business models, ii) an assessment of internal governance, iii) assessment of capital risks and adequacy of capital levels to mitigate them, and iv) assessment of risks to institutions' liquidity levels and the adequacy of liquidity sources to mitigate them);

- To develop a strong risk management culture focused on safeguarding the Bank's solvency and financing capacity, avoiding risk that may affect stakeholders, particularly depositors and ensuring a strong reputation and market image.


# Risk Culture 

Group's management is committed to permanently strengthening its respective risk culture whose current practice it promotes through the harmonisation of management concepts and assessment approaches, across all CGD Group Entitles, business areas and different risk dimensions, translating into a continuous development and improvement process.

The development of the Risk Culture should be based on full understanding and an integrated and global perspective of the risks to which the Group is exposed and the way in which they can be managed, having as a pillar the Risk Appetite and its widespread dissemination among the Group entities. It also supports the development of a Group risk culture and strengthens the governance framework of the risk management function based on a collection of corporate policies comprising practical risk management guidelines, in the form of concepts, principles and control procedures for each of the risks:

The adequate local implementation of risk management models principles, methodologies, metrics and risk reporting provided for in the corporate risk management policies guarantees the strengthening and alignment of a Group-wide risk management measurement system and consequent development of a risk culture in which all parties are fully aware of their responsibilities.

Within this framework, visits by risk management function Central to local risk management function are ensured, training sessions and workshops dedicated to matters within the scope of the function, as well as periodic and frequent meetings for alignment and dynamization of the common strategy

The dissemination of the risk culture across the organisation as a whole and particularly the first line of defense also comprises the Group management priority as the negotiating units are mainly responsible for day-to-day compliance with the Group's policies, procedures and controls based on its risk appetite.

The risk management function has therefore organized a number of specific training sessions for the first line of defence, with a view to promoting and disseminating the Group's risk culture.

## Risk Management

Risk management function in CGD Group is based on a governance model that complies with respective best practice, as set out in Community Guidelines on Internal Governance under Directive 2013/36/EU" (EBA/GL/2021/05) and to guarantee the solidity and effectiveness of the identification, measurement, monitoring, reporting and control system of the various risks incurred by the Group.

The person ultimately in charge of the risk management function in the Group is the "Chief Risk Officer" ("CRO"), as a member of the executive committee of CGD's board of directors. CGD's CRO has global responsibility for monitoring the Group's risk management framework and particularly for ensuring the adequate and effective operation of the risk management function and also having the duty to inform members of the administration and inspection bodies on the risks incurred, CGD's and CGD Group's global risk profile and level of compliance with the defined risk tolerance levels.

Risk management is carried out centrally and supported by a dedicated structure, the risk management division (DGR) under the responsibility of the CRO. The risk management division carries out functions in the area of management and control of the Group's financial and non-financial risks with the objectives of stability, solvency and financial strength, guaranteeing the functions of identification, assessment, monitoring, control and reporting of the risks to which the CGD Group is exposed and the interrelations between them, in order to ensure the coherent integration of its partial contributions, that they remain at the level of risk appetite defined by the board of directors and that they will not significantly affect the financial situation of the institution, continuously ensuring compliance with external standards and legal and regulatory requirements in this area.

The Head of Risk is directly responsible for the risk management function (managing director of DGR), who is also responsible, without prejudice to the other duties established in CGD's internal standards, for developing and leading a benchmark Division taking into account the dispositions of the RGICSF (Legal Framework of Credit Institutions and Financial Companies), other applicable legal texts and best international practice and standards, to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the risk management system and help make continuous improvements to a risk culture within CGD Group.

To fulfil its mission, the Risk Management Function is responsible for:

- Ensuring the implementation and monitoring of the risk appetite framework (RAF) under the terms of the internal RAF standard;
- Ensuring the development and implementation of a risk management system based on robust identification, assessment, oversight, prevention and risk control processes, risk oversight and, and coordinating the development of policies and procedures upon which these processes are based;
- Identifying the risks involved in the activity being performed on a separate, aggregate, present and prospective basis, assessing such risks and measuring exposure thereto using appropriate methodologies;
- Permanently overseeing risk generating activities and risk exposure, assessing them in the context of the approved risk appetite limits and defined risk limits and ensuring the planning of the corresponding capital and liquidity requirements in normal and adverse circumstances;
- Developing, implementing and monitoring of Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP) and the CGD Group Recovery Plan, as well as coordinating the production of the respective reports;
- Participating in the processes for the approval of new products and services and subcontracting of activities, based on an assessment of their respective associated risks and analysing CGD's management capacity of such risks;
- Ensuring that operations with related parties are revised and that CGD's real or potential risks, caused by them are identified and adequately assessed;
- Supporting the Risks Commission by means of specific analysis in advising the Board of Directors on measures that are expected to have an impact on CGD's strategy and risk profile.
- Advising administration and inspection bodies prior to making any decisions involving the taking of material risks, namely when involving acquisitions, disposals, mergers or the launch of new activities or products, for the purpose of ensuring the opportune and appropriate assessment of the impact of risk-taking in terms of CGD's and the Group's global risk exposure;
- Overseeing market evolution, legal and regulatory amendments in respect of the Risk Management function, strategic planning process and CGD and the Group's respective decisions to ensure that the actions of the function are permanently up-to-date;
- Developing and implementing early warning mechanisms for situations of default and breaches of the Risk Appetite or established limits;
- Producing and maintaining an up-to-date Risk Management Plan to ensure that all of CGD and the Group's material risks are adequately identified, assessed, overseen and reported in this context, it is worth mentioning the continued development of the framework for managing climate and environmental risks;
- Supplying information, analyses and pertinent, independent expert appraisals on risk positions, in addition to issuing an opinion on the compatibility of the risk-related proposals and decisions with CGD's risk tolerance/appetite;
- Producing and submitting reports with an adequate frequency on risk management to the administration and inspection bodies, including an assessment of the global risk profile and CGD's and the Group's various material risks, a summary of the main defects identified in control actions, including immaterial defects when considered separately but which could indicate a deteriorating trend in the internal control system in addition to the identification of recommendations that were (or not) implemented;
- Confirm/validate the successful resolution of internal control deficiencies in the 1st line of defense;
- Informing the administration and inspection bodies of any breach or violation (including their causes and a legal and economic analysis of the real cost of eliminating, reducing or offsetting

the risk position in light of the possible cost of the continuation thereof), informing, if appropriate, the areas in question and recommending any solutions;

# Main risks to which the Company is exposed 

Caixa Geral de Depósitos operates as a universal bank, with a full range of specialised financial services, providing its customers with a full service group, at a domestic and iinternational level.

CGD has an integrated presence in almost all banking business areas, namely: commercial banking, investment banking, brokerage and venture capital, real estate, asset management, specialised credit, inter alia, incurring solvency, liquidity and financing, credit, market, pension fund operational and non-financial risks.

# Solvency risk 

Solvency risk comprises the risk of negative impacts on profit or equity resulting from changes to regulatory or fiscal frameworks, including the risk of mismatches between capital adequacy and risk profile.

Solvency risk, formalised in the classification of CGD group risks, comprises fiscal, regulatory and internal capital risk areas.

Reference should be made, in terms of the oversight of solvency risk, to the regular monitoring of the adequacy between own funds and the risk profile.

From a regulatory viewpoint, this oversight comprises the regular measurement of regulatory capital requirements for Basel Pillar I risks: credit, market and operational risk. CGD group has adopted the standard method for the calculation of its own funds requirements for credit risk, as defined in chapter 2, heading II, part III of Regulation (EU) 575/2013 and, under Regulation (EU) No. 876/2019, applies since June 2021 the new method for calculating the value at risk of positions on derivatives, the so-called standard method for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR). Own funds requirements for the trading portfolio are measured by the application of the standard method to debt, capital and foreign exchange instruments and, lastly, own funds requirements for operational risk are based on the risk-weighted three year average of the relevant indicator, calculated each year for each activity segment as defined in the same regulation by the standard method.

Under Basel's Pillar II, the group performs an annual internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) to identify, measure and allocate capital to the risks to which the banking group is or is likely to be exposed. In addition to the annual ICAAP process, whose results are reported to the supervisor, the quantification of internal capital requirements for the most relevant risks is revised quarterly to ensure regular management oversight of internal capital needs and adequacy. This measurement is based on internally developed methodologies covering the following risk categories (i) credit risk (including credit concentration, sovereign risk and real estate; ii) market risk (including CVA, foreign exchange risk and credit spread risk); (iii) banking portfolio interest rate risk; (iv) Pension Fund Risk (v) operational risk including compliance risk and IT (vi) reputational risk and vi) Business and strategic risk.

In conformity with the approved risk framework and appetite statement, internal and regulatory capital adequacy is calculated on the plan upon which group strategy is implemented. Capital and short and medium term requirements plans are produced in the context of a base scenario but also consider the macroeconomic framework and adverse idiosyncratic events to enable an assessment of the sufficiency of the group's capital in adverse circumstances.

Compliance with the regulatory limit on exposure to a customer or group of customers, related on the basis of controlling or economic dependency is also assessed in the context of solvency risk. The calculation and monitoring of the leverage ratio is also ensured.

## Credit risk

Credit risk is associated with the losses and level of uncertainty regarding a customer's/counterparty's capacity to meet its obligations. Given the nature of banking activity, credit risk is particularly important, owing to its materiality, notwithstanding its interconnection with the remaining risks.

Credit risk is managed and controlled by internal regulations that, based on the use of a rating/scoring system and exposure level, an early warning system and classification of customers as being in financial distress, define the necessary levels of authority for the credit decision process.

For corporates, municipalities, autonomous regions and financial institutions with a more significant level of exposure, or with other added risk criteria/triggers, consideration of credit risk, in addition to being supported by internal rating models (including both financial and qualitative information), is individually examined by a team of analysts which produces credit risk analysis reports and issues an opinion on the inherent credit risk. The analysis is always produced on the basis of the economic group of which the proponent is a member and, after a certain exposure level has been reached, the analysis teams adopt a specialised sectoral approach.

Credit risk assessment in the retail segment is supported by the use of statistical risk assessment tools (PD - probability of default and LGD - loss given default models), several internal regulations which define objective criteria to be complied with on lending operations and the delegating of authority in accordance with the risk ratings on customers/operations.

CGD has implemented a centralised credit decision model to ensure separation between credit applications and decision-making functions, ensuring that all credit proposals originating in commercial areas are decided with the intervention of the Credit Risk Division, according to the criteria published in internal policies and regulations.

The monitoring of credit portfolios and control of credit risk, including compliance with the criteria for the decision on credit risk, are carried out regularly by the Risk Management Division, based on operational systems that identify the possibility of additional credit risk events on a daily basis, in addition to events that generate the automatic marking of credit which has been restructured on account of financial difficulties or defaults/non-performing exposures. Reports making reference to the performance and perceived quality of the credit portfolio are produced, in terms of i) new credit agreements, ii) credit which has been restructured owing to a customer's financial difficulties, iii) non-performing exposures, iv) default and v) concentration. These reports are submitted for the consideration of management bodies and shared with the first line of defence.

A process for measuring impairment losses related with default and the measurement of credit assets has also been implemented in CGD group and is overseen by the board of directors on a monthly basis in compliance with IFRS 9. The criteria and methodologies involved in the calculation of impairment subject to control and audit processes both by the internal bodies responsible for validation (Models Validation Office and Internal Audit Division) and CGD's external auditors who produce an independent report to be sent to the Bank of Portugal every six months. The Risk Management Division submits information on the evolution of provisions and impaired credit, to management bodies on a monthly basis. This includes the evolution of the portfolio by IFRS 9 stages and respective provisions and impaired credit levels.

# Market risk 

This translates into potentially negative impacts on the Institution's income or capital, deriving from unfavourable price movements of portfolio assets. It includes the impact of adverse changes in foreign exchange rates in the balance sheet's foreign exchange position.

The group has also approved a corporate market risk management policy which defines the responsibilities and sets out the principles applicable to market risk management, including foreign exchange risk, on a separate and consolidated basis, in addition to all overseas branches and subsidiaries in the prudential supervision perimeter. The management and market risk tolerance strategy is defined in accordance with CGD group's risk appetite statement, with the objective of maintaining the focus of the group's activity on products and services commensurate with the strategy of a retail/commercial bank, limiting the complexity of products and positions and ensuring that they are in line with existing risk monitoring capabilities.

Market risk and foreign exchange position risk management in the balance sheet is additionally supported by a formal authorisations structure - market or foreign exchange risk guidelines - requiring the approval of the capital, assets and liabilities executive board (CALCO). The guidelines formalise, inter alia, business, risk management and control strategies, authorised instruments, metrics and their market risk limits, constituting such business units' discretionary boundary on hedging or mitigating market risk.

Market concentration and liquidity, market risk and loss levels indicators ensure that the levels of risk taken are commensurate with the group's risk appetite framework. The limits are controlled, monitored and reported daily or on an intraday basis to management bodies (CRO and CFO) and business units. The operating rules when limits are exceeded, which aim to ensure a speedy definition of the action plan and resolution of the excess, are defined in internal regulations.

The control, monitoring and reporting of market and foreign exchange risk is centrally ensured by the risk management division's market risk area, which reports to the CRO. A reporting line which is independent from the business areas reporting to the CFO or other members of the executive committee has therefore been established. CGD's risk committee is responsible for overseeing CGD's and CGD group entities' market and foreign exchange risks.

The trading book is used to calculate own funds requirements for market risk. It comprises all securities and derivatives held-for-trading or to hedge held-for-trading positions, as part of CGD group's trading book strategy and in compliance with the trading book's internal definition. It specifically includes market-making positions, short positions in securities, rotating short positions in stock market derivatives, arbitrage positions

or when the intention involves short-term resale and intentional or correlation trading portfolios or resulting from the services provided to customers. Any hedge of listed items or dynamic hedges on items that, on their own, would only qualify for the banking book are an integral part of the trading book. This portfolio is actively managed, taking into account the timeframe for holding the assets provided for in CGD group's trading book strategy, as well as being reassessed on a daily basis as regards fair value in line with the principles of independence, precision, clarity and rigour, defined in the bank's internal regulations corporate valuation policy on own positions in securities and derivatives recognised at fair value. All balance sheet positions contributing to the foreign exchange position (including off balance sheet positions) are taken into account for the calculation of own funds requirements for foreign exchange risk, including both trading and banking books.

The risk assessment considers general market risks, non-linear risks and specific risks attached to the positions held. Value at risk (VaR), expected shortfall (ES) and three worst (3W) risk metrics are used for this purpose, VaR is used as a yardstick for monitoring market risks in general and is based on the historical simulation approach. VaR is calculated for an investment timeframe of 1 day ( $95 \%$ confidence interval) for management trading portfolios and a holding period of 10 days ( $99 \%$ confidence interval) for the group's remaining portfolios, including prudential trading portfolio and the accounting trading portfolio perimeters. Risk assessment is further complemented by such risk measures as duration, bpv, Greeks (delta, gamma, rho, vega and theta).

To assess the quality of the VaR model used, monthly VaR is compared on a daily basis with the actual results obtained ("backtesting") in line with the methodologies and recommendations issued by the Basel Committee, with the additional application of other adequate backtesting approaches.

The group carries out stress tests at least once a month, focusing on market and foreign exchange rate risk, as part of the overall stress test programme and in accordance with current best practice. Stress tests aim to assess the impact of adverse events involving exposure to market risk, measuring their impact on the fair value of the investments and the quantitative and qualitative adequacy of the group's own funds. Stress tests are based on risk factors that, as a whole, represent situations that could originate extraordinary losses on portfolios subject to market risk. These factors specifically include events with a low possibility of occurrence associated with the principal types of risk, including various market and foreign exchange risk components.

Market risk in the group is identified on the basis of a robust, continuously reliable, centralised and integrated structure which aims to ensure timely and complete knowledge of the products traded, allowing the identification, measurement, control and reporting of market risk. The registration of transactions in the front office system, which is the basis for identifying the object of the risk, is regulated by specific internal regulations which ensure that the information transmission process is complied with and that it is conveyed to the market risk system reliably to evaluate the respective metrics. With regard to foreign exchange rate risk, identification is also ensured on the basis of the rigorous, standardised and timely transmission of information on the foreign exchange rate position of CGD and any CGD group entity.

# Pension fund risk 

The Group continued until December 31, 2022 to operate a defined benefit pension plan for the former and current employees of Caixa Geral de Depósitos SA, subject to certain conditions governing inclusion. This plan had been closed to new participants since 2005. The capacity to meet pension plan liabilities was hedged by the management of an assets portfolio whose strategy had been approved by the members' board of directors, under the management of an independent management entity. Regular contributions to the fund by the member and participants were also stipulated.

In this context, pension fund risk derived from mismatches between pension fund assets and liabilities. Such mismatches could arise from the depreciation of the market value of pension fund assets or from the increase in the estimated value of pension liabilities due to actuarial, demographic or market factors. Depending on the magnitude and reason for the mismatch, the CGD while member may had to make up for potential shortfalls or resolve deficiencies, in the form of extraordinary contributions to the pension fund.

This risk with the pension fund risk was monitored throughout the year in terms of the risk appetite statement, with monthly reporting to the executive and risk committees. The calculation monitors the deviations in value between the assets portfolio and the estimated value of liabilities, the evolution of the performance of the assets portfolio in addition to the prospective evolution of the liabilities discount rate, with the aim of mitigating possibly significant or at least, unforeseen mismatches.

On February 24, 2023, the Portuguese government published Decree-Law 14/2023, which transfers all liabilities covered by the Caixa Geral de Depósitos Staff Pension Fund (CGDPF) to Caixa Geral de

Aposentações (CGA), extinguishing and liquidating CGDPF and determining that CGD transfer to CGA a financial compensation for the reassigned responsibilities.

# Interest rate risk in the banking portfolio 

Balance sheet interest rate risk is the risk incurred in the activity of a financial institution whenever, during the course of its activity, it contracts for operations whose financial flows are sensitive to interest rate changes. Put in different words it is the risk of the occurrence of a change in the interest rate associated with the mismatching of interest rate re-fixing periods between assets and liabilities held, with a decrease in yield or increase in financial cost.

The particular dichotomy, in the case of assets and liabilities held by credit institutions, between short, medium and long term fixed and variable-rate portfolios, may also lead to interest rate risk as regards the risk of mismatches between re-fixing periods, basis risk and yield curve risk, for which matters involving the assessment of interest rate risk in the banking portfolio should be closely monitored.

Guidelines defining the roles and responsibilities of the various parties, metrics to be monitored, limits on such metrics and the control system on these limits have been established for the management and control of banking portfolio interest rate risk. The process of monitoring the size of the exposure to this risk results in the monthly production of reports supporting the monitoring of compliance vis-à-vis existing guidelines and subject to a monthly assessment by CALCO (and the executive committee in the context of the integrated risk report).

## Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk in the banking business area can occur in the event of i) difficulties in resource-taking to finance assets, normally leading to higher costs but which may also imply a restriction on asset growth, or ii) difficulties in promptly meeting obligations to third parties caused by significant mismatches between residual periods to maturity of assets and liabilities.

Guidelines have been defined for the roles and responsibilities of the different actors, the metrics to be monitored, the limits on such metrics and the control system on such limits for the management and control of liquidity risk guidelines The process of monitoring the size of exposure to these risks results in the monthly production of reports supporting the monitoring of compliance vis-à-vis existing guidelines subject to a monthly assessment by CALCO (and the executive committee in the context of the integrated risk report).

## Non-Financial Risks

## Operational risk

Operational risk comprises the risk of negative impacts on results or capital deriving from failures of analysis, processing or settlement of operations, internal and external fraud, use of subcontracted resources, internal processes involving the making of ineffective decisions, insufficient or inadequate human resources and situations of the inoperability of infrastructures.

The management of operational risk at CGD Group adopts a methodology supported by an end-to-end approach, implemented both at CGD and at its branches and subsidiaries.

The referred to methodology includes the definition, oversight and reporting of tolerance and risk appetite limits for the Group as a whole. It also includes the identification of operational risk events, the analysis of new products and services, monitoring of subcontracted activities, self-assessment of risks and controls associated with processes and key risk management indicators, as well as the promotion of action plans designed to mitigate exposure to operational risk, based on the implementation of adequate control and riskmitigating procedures. It also includes the identification of deficiencies in internal control and the assessment of the quality and completeness of the proposed action plans to resolve the respective recommendations, as well as the process of validating the implementation of the recommendations for mitigating operational risk.

The methodology implemented in the Group is supported by a corporate governance model and includes the disclosure of information through an internal reporting system that includes the regular Committees/Executive Committees and the disclosure of reports to various Group structures.

# Other non-financial risks 

Following its definition was formalised in the latest revision of CGD Group`s risk taxonomy, non-financial risks in the CGD Group include four key risks, namely: Strategy and business, Model, Information technology (IT) and Reputational. These risks consist of the likelihood of negative impacts on results or capital depending on the risk category, namely:

- Strategy and business risk: losses deriving from macroeconomic, geopolitical, positioning and business strategy, investment, equity investments in banks and non-banking entities, climate change and pandemics;
- Model risk: losses motivated by decisions that can be taken mainly based on the results of internal models, due to the occurrence of errors in the development, application or use of these models;
- IT risk: losses deriving from the risk of change, data integrity, IT system failures, ciber risk and the delivery risk of IT systems;
- Reputational risk: losses originating from the negative perception of CGD's public image (banking activity, bancassurance, asset management and risk of the protection of confidential data).

A specific management model for such risks has been implemented for the identification, evaluation, measurement, oversight, control and reporting of non-financial risks across the group as a whole. The main objective is to achieve an integrated monitoring system on the adequacy and effectiveness of processes, policies and procedures, different non-financial risks components and to autonomously and independently ensure its effectiveness by keeping losses on non-financial risks to within the tolerance levels defined by CGD's board of directors. The non-financial risk management model also aims to mitigate other relevant negative impacts, such as the level of achievement of strategic objectives, reputation or fulfilment of regulatory requirements.

The methodology implemented is based on a non-financial risk corporate policy and a Corporate Reputational Risk Policy that establishes all of the principles and responsibilities applicable to the management of such risks. One of the main elements of this methodology is CGD group's risk classification system, which uses a unique, common language for the three lines of defence, within a framework of coordinated intervention between them, establishing a basis on which the group can create an integrated approach for its management of all non-financial risks.

## Business Continuity Policy

CGD is certified to the international ISO 22301:2019 - business continuity management system (BCMS) standard and is annually audited by an external entity in the form of the British Standards Institution (BSI), for monitoring/overseeing its respective certification. In group terms, CGD continues to oversee and develop projects for the support/implementation of the good practice framework issued by the Bank of Portugal (circular letter 47/2021 of 20 September - Recommendations on business continuity management) with its entities abroad.

The Business Continuity Policy applies to all critical business areas, physical and technological support infrastructures and the involvement of Caixa Geral de Depósitos, S.A.'s human resources in Portugal.

It reflects CGD`s commitment to ensuring business continuity in the event of anomalous occurrences which could compromise its normal operating activities, safeguarding the interests of its customers, the Portuguese state as its sole shareholder, the financial system and the supervisory authorities, its employees and other interested parties.

This is achieved through a Business Continuity Management System which covers the policies, allocation of responsibilities, processes and procedures designed to enable CGD to prevent serious incidents caused by anomalous events, or, if this is not possible, effectively respond to such incidents, ensuring the continuity of its critical business functions at minimum acceptable levels and achieving the following objectives:

- Safeguarding human life and the well-being of anyone inside CGD's infrastructure;
- Protecting CGD's image of strength and trustworthiness;
- Keeping its customers satisfied;
- Ensuring critical business processes;

- Mantaining adequate and operational continuity solutions; and
- Complying with legal and regulatory obligations.

The Business Continuity Policy is based on the following principles:

- Identification of the business processes upon which critical business functions are based and their priorities and recovery requirements - analysing the impact of interruptions to business processes over time, assessing recovery priorities and the resources upon which they are based (information systems, human resources, infrastructures, suppliers);
- Assessment of the exposure of critical business processes to events which may compromise its continuity owing to the unavailability of the resources on which they are based and assessing the risk exposure level;
- Implementation of warning, response and recovery mechanisms for incidents deriving from such events defining and implementing a Business Continuity Strategy enabling the elimination of reduction of the probability of the occurrence of incidents or, if this is not possible, to recover the critical business processes within the defined periods, ensuring the continuity of its products and services at minimum acceptable levels, if such events effectively occur;
- Monitoring and continuous improvement of CGD's capacity to ensure its Business Continuity based on exercises, tests and reviews of plans, an analysis of performance indicators and periodic audits. The business should be continuously improved through the application of corrective, preventative and improvement actions deriving from such activities;
- Incorporation of a Business Continuity culture in CGD - ensuring that all employees understand their responsibilities, based on awareness-raising actions.

Information on the Business Continuity Policy is provided to all CGD employees and the general public.

# Internal government and corporate policy 

Pursuant to the internal governance guidelines of the European Banking Authority (EBA / GL / 2017/11), in addition to the RGICSF and related legislation, CGD has the duty to ensure that its systems, processes and governance mechanisms, in addition to its internal control systems, are consistent and well integrated on a consolidated and sub-consolidated basis and are applied to their subsidiaries in order to ensure robust governance systems on a consolidated and sub-consolidated basis.

Together with the mechanism for disclosing information on the standards provided for in its internal governance policy, CGD has also set up mechanisms and contacts with its overseas branches and its subsidiaries in Portugal and overseas, for the adoption of CGD's internal governance structuring standards. This mechanism for disclosing information on the standards was based on respect for the particularities of the foreign legal systems of the headquarters of CGD group entities and concerted positions with other shareholders in the case of subsidiaries that are not wholly owned by CGD.

The remuneration policy for members of management and supervisory bodies, suitability policy for the selection of members of management and supervisory bodies, key function holders and managers of overseas branches and succession plan have been adopted by CGD Group entities as structuring standards.

With the same objective having been adopted across-the-board by CGD group entities and with the objective of strengthening the oversight and monitoring of their activities, particularly focusing on their core operations, the areas of competence of the respective risk committees and audit and control committees, including their operating regulations and authority of the referred to committees and representation of CGD's control functions were either created and/or readjusted during the course of 2019 and 2020. Reporting procedures between risk and local audit and control committees, their counterparts in CGD and the Audit Committee and the provision of information by such entities' audit committees and CGD's Audit Committee were also defined and implemented.

## Strategic Plan for the Risk Management Function

FGR has developed a new strategic plan for the 2022-2024 three year period as part of the process of strengthening the CGD group's risk management function (FGR) and adapting it to new external and internal requirements and circumstances.

The plan comprises 10 strategic pillars with the following core objectives:

- To consolidate DGR's functional model, reallocating responsibilities and redesigning internal processes, fostering efficiency and focus on the management and analysis of the risks to which CGD group is exposed, in addition to anticipating future and emerging risks. To ensure that CGD group's risk management function has adequate skills and resources for the development of its activities, ensuring the retention of internally identified and developed talent.
- To continue to strengthen and foster a strong risk culture in the first line of defence, ensuring total alignment and commitment to comply with the defined risk strategy, in addition to greater knowledge and awareness of risk issues and their impacts. To ensure that the 1st line of defence has the necessary knowledge and tools for the development of commercial activities, always keeping in mind and aiming to defend the bank's robustness.
- To strengthen oversight of local risk management functions, seeking to ensure greater harmonisation between local and corporate procedures, in addition to the correct and adequate application of the principles set out in corporate policies.
- To ensure the coherence, completeness and integrity of the data used to monitor and control risk, ensuring alignment with BCBS 239 principles.
- To strengthen the IT risk management framework and DGR's role as the 2nd line of defence, ensuring greater critical capacity in terms of this risk area and total independence of the 1st line.
- To define a climate risk governance and monitoring framework in order to ensure a close and complete oversight of all such risk areas and impacts in CGD group.

Reference should be made to the following non-recurring activities in 2022:

- Successful participation in the stress tests exercise focused on climate risk and in the thematic review on climate and environmental risks
- Participation in the design and implementation of an operational plan focused on customers exposed to the impact of energy costs, inflation and the war in Ukraine, in addition to the operational plan to provide for decree law 80-A/2022 on the restructuring measures to be applied to mortgage loans for borrowers' permanent residence in response to interest rate hikes.
- Production of credit risk assessment models in entities (ratings across all entities and scorings for the main portfolios), models for the development of the climate risk management framework, together with other models of relevance to the business.
- Centralisation of data collection processes and production of risk reports to promote the efficiency and harmonisation of quality criteria and documentary support.
- Dissemination of the risk culture, comprising the implementation of processes on i) selfassessments of risk culture, and ii) visits to entities, in addition to the training programme for the first line of defence.


# 3.6.3. Regulations and codes 

## Internal and external regulations applicable

CGD's activity is subject to the legal rules applicable to public limited companies, namely the commercial companies code, in addition to the regulations governing the state's business sector, owing to its status as a public company (cf. decree law 133/2013 of 3 October ${ }^{10}$ and law 52/2019 of 31 July, approving the regulations on the functions performed by holders of political and other high public office). CGD's activity is also governed by its statutes.

CGD's activities are also regulated by European and national legislation. In terms of national law, this particularly includes the general credit and financial corporations regulations (RGICSF) and the securities

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{10}$ Changed by law 75-A2014 of 30 September and law 42/2016 of 28 December.

code in addition to all regulatory standards issued by the Bank of Portugal and the securities market committee.

A positive aspect, in 2022, owing to the development of the epidemiological situation deriving from Covid19 was a reduction in the need for new measures and renewal of those already approved, culminating in the publication of council of ministers' resolution 96/2022 of 4 October determining the cessation of the application of council of ministers' regulations published in the sphere of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The year 2022 was marked by the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.
In response to this military aggression, the European Union approved successive packages of restrictive measures, on:

- The prohibition on providing funds or economic resources to specific lists of persons and entities;
- Financial services and businesses, including the exclusion of the major Russian banks from the Swift system and the prohibition/limitation of deposits of more than $€ 100,000$ by Russian citizens or entities;
- Tightening and extending export controls on dual-use goods;
- Export and import bans on an extensive list of products.

Owing to rising inflation, statutes to mitigate the impact of inflation on Portuguese incomes have been published, of wish stands out the law 19/2022, of 21 October, that, inter alia, establishes regulations on redemptions of savings plans without incurring any penalty, in addition to decree law 80-A/2022 of 25 November which sets out measures designed to mitigate the effects of the increases in reference rate indexes on loan agreements for the acquisition or construction of permanent own residence.

Notwithstanding the regulations on the action plan for the risk of default (PARI) and extrajudicial procedure for the settlement of situations of default (PERSI) established by decree law 227/2012 of 25 October and strengthened in 2021, the government, owing to interest rate hikes, considered it necessary to strengthen the preventative mechanisms to be adopted by institutions in anticipation of the risks or possibility of default situations. Institutions are accordingly obliged to implement measures allowing assessments to be made on the increase of the debt-to-income ratio and application of the above referred to decree law 227/2012 when such an increase is detected. These regulations will remain in force until 31 December 2023.

Regulations and recommendations on sustainability were published.
Commission delegated regulation (EU) 2022/1288, which supplements regulation (EU) 2019/2088 on regulatory technical standards specifying in greater detail the content and presentation of information related to the "do not significantly harm" principle, content, methodologies and presentation of information related to sustainability indicators and negative impacts on sustainability and the content and presentation of information related to the promotion of environmental or social characteristics and sustainable investment objectives in pre-contractual documents on websites and periodic reports was published.

Reference should also be made to the publication of directive (EU) no. 2022/2464 amending regulation (EU) no. 537/2014, directive no. 2004/109/EC, directive no. 2006/43/EC and directive no. 2013/34/EU as regards corporate sustainability reports.

Such amendments particularly include the amendments to directive no. 2013/34/EU (on annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements) who start to demand- Reports not only on the need for sufficient information for an understanding of the evolution, performance and position of companies but also on the information needed to understand the impact of a company's activities on environmental, social and worker issues, respect for human rights, combating corruption and attempted bribery. Companies are required to report information on the impact of their activities on people and the environment, in addition to how they are affected by sustainability issues. This directive should be transposed by member states no later than 6 July 2024.

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) also published the "Principles for the effective management and supervision of climate-related financial risks" document which sets out principles for the effective management and supervision of climate-related financial risks in order to improve banks' risk management and supervisors' practice as regards climate-related financial risks.

As regards anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), the Bank of Portugal, following a public consultation, published its notice 1/2022, repealing notice 2/2018 and instruction

2/2021. The new notice regulates the conditions governing the performance, procedures, instruments, mechanisms, application formalities, reporting obligations and other aspects necessary to ensure compliance with preventative ML/FT duties, within the scope of the activity of financial entities subject to the supervision of the Bank of Portugal. It also regulates the means and mechanisms necessary to fulfil the duties related to the implementation and enforcement of restrictive measures approved by the UN or EU and the measures to be adopted by payment service providers to detect transfers of funds in cases in which information on the payer or payee is omissive or incomplete and the procedures they adopt to manage fund transfers that are not accompanied by the information required by regulation (EU) no. 2015/847.

The EBA, herein, has published guidelines on compliance management policies and procedures and the role and responsibilities of the AML/CFT compliance officer in accordance with article 8 and chapter VI of directive (EU) no. 2015/849.

These guidelines specify the role, functions and responsibilities of the AML/CFT compliance_officer, management body and senior management member responsible for AML/CFT compliance, in addition to policies, controls and internal procedures.

The EBA has also published guidelines on the remote use of customer onboarding solutions. They establish common standards on the development and implementation of sound and risk-sensitive due diligence policies and processes in the context of remote customer onboarding.

Law 23-A/2022, transposing directive (EU) no. 2019/878 on access to banking activity and prudential supervision and directive (EU) no. 2019/879 on the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment companies has been published, amending the RGICSF, securities code and related legislation.

This law has essentially made extensive amendments/additions to the RGICSF, particularly as regards the following subjects:

- Introduction of the ML/FT criterion in assessing worker suitability;
- Provision of information on loans to members of management and supervisory boards, respective spouses, de facto unions or first-degree relatives, companies of which they are part or over which they may wield significant influence;
- Risk resulting from changes in interest rates;
- Internal reporting of irregularities;
- Additional own funds;
- Recovery plan;
- Intra-group financial support;
- Remuneration and variable remuneration policies;
- Own funds reserves; and
- Resolution.

Regulation (EU) no. 2022/2554 on the digital operational resilience of the financial sector in the cybersecurity area was also published.

This regulation establishes uniform requirements regarding the security of network and information systems upon which the operational processes of financial entities are based.

Three directives on cybersecurity and digital operational resilience have also been published, but still need to be transposed into national law:

- Directive (EU) no. 2022/2555 on measures to ensure a high common level of cybersecurity in the Union, amending regulation (EU) no. 910/2014 and directive (EU) no. 2018/1972 and repealing directive (EU) no. 2016/1148 (NIS2 directive).
- Directive (EU) no. 2022/2556 amending directives nos. 2009/65/EC, 2009/138/EC, 2011/61/EU, 2013/36/EU, 2014/59/EU, 2014/65/EU, 2015/2366/EU and 2016/2341/EU as regards digital operational resilience for the financial sector; and
- Directive (EU) no. 2022/2557 on the resilience of critical entities.

Regulation (EU) no. 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of natural persons regarding the treatment and free circulation of personal data, repealing directive no. 95/46/CE (GDPR), was published on 4 May 2016 as part of the European digital agenda, which aims to achieve a digital single market in the European Union.

The GDPR, which is fully applicable to member states of the Union from 24 May 2018, strengthens the rights and guarantees of personal data subjects, giving them control over the treatment of their respective personal data, defines a series of processing principles and rules to be complied with by companies which are responsible for processing personal data and attributes a series of functions to the "data protection officer", namely advising the processing officer over the control of conformity with the new regulatory requirements on data protection and as a liaison officer with the national control authority and personal data subjects.

Law 58/2019, ensuring the transposition of the GDPR into national legislation, complementing the approximately 70 open GDPR clauses left to the legislative discretion of national lawmakers, and including several innovations, was published on 8 August.

This new regulatory framework is also based on law 59/2019 of 8 August, which approves rules on the treatment of personal data for the purposes of the prevention, detection, investigation or repression of criminal offences or enforcement of penal sanctions, transposing directive (EU) no. 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016.

Following the publication of law 58/2019, the national data protection board, on 3 September 2019, issued its ruling 2019/494 on the elimination of several of the standards of law 58/2019 and ruling 2019/495 on the waiving of fines levied on public entities during the three year period starting from the date upon which law 58/2019 came into force.

The national data protection committee has been issuing opinions and guidelines on several matters, particularly in 2022, on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism operations, as requested by the Bank of Portugal, with a view to repealing notice 2/2018 of 26 September and instruction 2/2021, of 26 February; in addition to having instructed telecommunications suppliers to delete data stored under law 32/2008, following the publication of the judgment declaring several of the standards to be unconstitutional.

As for the European data protection board (EDPB), created by the GDPR, reference should be made, by way of example, to the announcement of the beginning of a coordinated supervisory action involving 22 data protection authorities in the European Economic Area (EEA), including the European data protection supervisor (EDPS) who will investigate how (national) public entities are using "cloud" based services.

The European data protection board, in addition to the following binding guidelines on organisations and companies, adopted in 2022 the following guidelines: i) on 19 January, guidelines on the rights of data subjects, focusing on the right of access. The guidelines analyse various aspects of the right of access and provide more precise instructions on how this right can be exercised, clarifying its scope, the information to be provided to the data subject by the controller, format of the request, the main mode of granting access and the notion of manifestly unfounded or excessive requests; ii) on 15 March, guidelines on article 60 of the GDPR as part of the EDPB strategy and work programme for 2021-2022 with the aim of supporting effective law enforcement and efficient cooperation between national control authorities. The guidelines provide a detailed description of cooperation between the national control authorities under the GDPR and aim to further enhance the coherent application of the legal provisions relating to the one-stop shop mechanism; iii) on 12 May, guidelines on the practical application of friendly settlement agreements; iv) on 10 October, guidance on notifications of data violations.

The group's personal data protection policy in the form of corporate internal regulation 11/2018 was revised in 2022 to accommodate regulatory developments and guidelines and the understanding of the national supervisory authority on personal data protection, whose revised version has been transposed into CGD group entities.

As regards the group's data protection governance model in the form of its corporate internal regulation 4/2019 which aims to implement this policy, defining the data protection management cycle and responsibilities allocated to CGD and the group, the oversight and monitoring of these activities with the aim of strengthening the data protection compliance organisational culture, CGD group entities have completed the respective transposition process into their respective internal regulations.

CGD has an "internal standards system" (SNI) which is accessible to and binding upon all workers. It covers the most relevant aspects of the company's operation and performance of its activity, compliance with legislation and regulations.

# Application of competition and consumer protection standards 

In the performance of its activity, Caixa Geral de Depósitos is governed by ethical principles, set out in its code of conduct, in pursuit of its objectives of profitability, quality, customer satisfaction, fair prices and strict compliance with competition and banking customer protection standards.

## Revision of standards on transparency and customer relationships

CGD permanently oversees the publication of new legal and regulatory obligations, in addition to the issue of recommendations and definition of good practice by the supervisors, with the objective of adjusting its activity to the new normative requirements.

Item 3.6.3. makes reference to a collection of statutes published in 2022. They include, inter alia, the adoption of successive packages of restrictive measures by the European Union, statutes designed to mitigate the impact of inflation on the income of Portuguese citizens, in addition to sustainability-related regulations and recommendations.

To adjust its performance in line with the referred to behavioural standards, CGD has systematically analysed its practice and internal standards on such matters, identifying opportunities for improvement, in its preparation of future legal and regulatory changes.

## Product marketing

Owing to the nature and importance of financial products and services in citizens' day-to-day lives, they are constantly scrutinised by supervisors in addition to customers and consumer protection, self-regulating, sectoral representation and legislative entities.

Financial products and services marketed by CGD are subject to strict internal control mechanisms, from their design up to their marketing and disclosure/advertising stages, for the purpose of ensuring scrupulous compliance with all legal and regulatory obligations, in addition to best practice as publicised by international and national entities and CGD's ethical principles.

## Corporate policy on the management, approval and monitoring of products

The governance, approval and monitoring of products policy (PGAMP) which came into effect on 18 November 2018 and is currently in force, defines the operating principles behind the internal approval of products in due compliance with the governance and monitoring guidelines and formal policy on the approval of new products/services.

The development of new products/services is focused on specific target customers, ensuring that their interests, objectives and characteristics are taken into account, with the formal indication and justification of the customer's objectives that the product aims to meet and the characteristics of such target customers.

This corporate policy is directly applicable to CGD group companies and may be adjusted as necessary or convenient based on local specificities and circumstances, previously validated by the risk management division and CGD's compliance division and latterly authorised by CGD entities' management.

## Codes of conduct and ethics

The values, ethical principles and standards of professional conduct governing the performance of CGD and its workers have been published in its code of conduct.

This code is a fundamental instrument for the management of CGD's ethics as a self-regulating document which must be complied with in and by CGD. It helps to:

- Harmonise reference standards vis-à-vis ethical dilemmas;
- Affirm the values, performance principles and standards of conduct governing relationships with various interested parties;
- Promote an organisational culture of legal compliance and conformity with the values and principles adopted; and
- Develop best corporate governance and ethical conduct practice.

An in-depth review of CGD's code of conduct, in April 2020, resulted in the strengthening of provisions on ethical issues, such as, inter alia, the prevention of corruption, social responsibility and sustainable development and conflicts of interest.

In 2022, CGD provided its workers with training on the topics set out in the code, including examples of good practice and practical cases in order to facilitate learning.

CGD's code of conduct is available on its intranet and website at: https://www.cgd.pt/Governo-Sociedade-CGD/Regulamentos/Documents/Codigo-de-Conduta-CGD.pdf

CGD also has a code of good conduct for preventing and combating harassment in the workplace, complying with the latest developments in the labour code to strengthen the legislative framework designed to prevent harassment in the workplace and in accordance with CGD's own code of conduct. The code aims to identify conduct that may be considered as being harassment in the workplace and defines measures to prevent and combat them. It comprises a framework-guide for all CGD workers.

# Implementation of standards on the prevention of corruption and action plans to prevent and mitigate fraud 

## Prevention and mitigation of fraud

The primary objectives of the compliance division's prevention and management of fraud area is to prevent and manage external fraud incidents in order to reduce CGD's exposure to risk situations through its adoption of containment/mitigation measures on incidents of fraud, based on several activities, such as:

- The monitoring and analysis of fraud alerts and situations reported by internal channels and external entities, assessing the need to implement additional preventative measures, in addition to the existence of possible systemic effects and patterns of action in articulation with the relevant divisions and/or external entities for the identification of new patterns of customer behaviour, possible contaminations of occurrences and new procedures to be adopted;
- The evaluation of the efficacy and efficiency of the processes implemented in CGD in the sphere of combating fraud, identifying possible opportunities for improvement to be implemented, promoting the implementation of monitoring mechanisms and the continuous identification of solutions and/or tools to ensure the reduction of operational risk and maintenance of the quality of service provided to customers;
- The regular publication of news, alerts or issue of recommendations designed to keep pace with trends and new types of fraud with the primary objective of curtailing instances of fraud and preventing the future occurrence thereof;
- The analysis of situations identified by internal controls or alerts received by external entities/international brands in the issuing and acquiring spheres in order to assess the existence of incidents of fraud and possible adoption of any containment measures seen to be necessary.

To further its activities in the sphere of the prevention and management of external fraud, the compliance division has a specific communication channel with all of the parties involved and assists CGD's various structural bodies on situations which are indicative of instances of fraud. The area for the prevention and management of fraud has also, accordingly, defined and implemented control mechanisms and procedures to mitigate the risk of (external) fraud, working directly with other units in the anti-financial crime area with a view to preventing and combating various types of crime, particularly money laundering and the financing of terrorism.

Upon discovery of an instance of external fraud, preventive measures commensurate with the specific instance are taken. These may involve the introduction of precautionary measures on customers or the implementation of other preventative measures to control capital flows in suspect accounts. Whenever justified, occurrences determining the development of more specific analyses give rise to the start of the corresponding verification processes.

## Prevention of corruption and related infractions

The fact that CGD's governance model is based on effective separation between management and audit functions helps to prevent and mitigate diverse risks inherent to the activities of credit institutions, such as the risks of corruption and its associated infractions.

As part of its internal control system, CGD has implemented standing measures designed to prevent and repress the crime of corruption and its associated infractions. These measures are reflected in diverse procedures and internal standards of which special reference should be made to the code of conduct, policy for the prevention of corruption and associated infractions, global policy for the prevention and management of conflicts of interest or the internal reporting system on irregular practice.

In addition to the above referred to procedures and internal standards, all of the activity of CGD and its workers is governed by the principle of the active rejection of all forms of corruption. Such imperative professional conduct has been set out in article 34 of its code of conduct that expressly states the following:
a) CGD actively rejects all forms of corruption and its workers should not be involved in situations which may lead to acts which may be associated therewith.
b) CGD's activity is subject to rigorous internal control mechanisms, which include internal standards geared to preventing and combating corruption.

It should also be noted that the PPCIC ("policy for the prevention of corruption and associated infractions") is a corporate standard which establishes guideline principles on the detection and prevention of corruption and associated infractions, lists the areas potentially more exposed thereto and describes prevention measures and lists the respective officers and rules applicable to the monitoring, assessment and revisions of the actual policy.

This policy also enables workers to report situations which have come to their knowledge and which they deem to be corruption based on the use of defined internal or external mechanisms, namely the internal reporting system on irregular practice (SCIPI) whose objectives are also related to preventing and countering corruption.

The PPCIC's provisions are also and whenever necessary, complemented by specific internal standards or other instruments.

In order to strengthen these instruments and in view of the provisions of decree law 109-E/2021 of 7 December which created the national anti-corruption mechanism and establishes the general regulations on the prevention of corruption, CGD has systemised its plan for the prevention of corruption and related infractions, by means of which each structural body identifies the risks of corruption associated with each and indicates the measures adopted to mitigate their occurrence, as defined in the policy for the prevention of corruption, related infractions and measures and action plans to be implemented.

In 2022, CGD's compliance division provided workers from different CGD structural bodies with training on the prevention of corruption.

Through the offices of its internal audit division (DAI) in the sphere of its permanent audit system, CGD monitors a series of indicators and alerts on operations whose characteristics could indicate the potential existence of fraud. Such indicators permanently and automatically activate audit alarms, which may require the need to question the parties involved in the respective operations.

In addition to a continuous monitoring aspect, Caixa has a specialised DAI team which addresses internal fraud on the basis of a strategy of investigation, conclusion and proposal for disciplinary procedures and/or remediation (mitigation) of the root cause.

The investigations, carried out following the report of an occurrence, complaint or denunciation, aim to identify any irregularities committed, either deliberately or negligently, and their respective perpetrators (employees) in addition to proposing the eventuality of any disciplinary, civil (right of redress) or criminal liability, to the executive committee with a view to recovering the amounts of any losses suffered by Caixa. Whenever, during the course of these investigations, control weaknesses or the need to improve operational and/or control procedures are identified, recommendations are addressed to the internal entities/structural bodies best suited to examine them in greater detail and implement them.

DAI has provided all Caixa employees with a mailbox facility to enable them to report situations of (i) harassment in the workplace or sexual harassment and (ii) allegations of internal fraud. DAI also has a tool for registering all occurrences related to internal fraud, in addition to all of the measures taken to remedy (mitigate) the situation, which are followed up on a periodic basis.

The identification of any occurrences which may be related with corruption will be dealt with by DAI in the sphere of its authority and incorporated in the above referred to register.

Reference should, lastly be made to the fact that the report identifying the risks and occurrences of corruption and related infractions in 2022 was published on CGD's website in March 2023 and is available at:
https://www.cgd.pt/Institucional/Governo-Sociedade-CGD/Praticas-de-Bom-Governo/Documents/Relatorio-Ocorrencias-Corrupcao-Infracoes-Conexas.pdf

# Compliance with Legislation and Regulations 

## Report on remuneration paid to men and women

With a view to promoting gender equality in the labor market and progressively eliminating wage inequalities between women and men, Council of Ministers Resolution No. gender parity. In this context, the entities of the Public Business Sector were obliged to prepare, every three years, a report characterizing the salary differences associated with the remuneration paid to their employees.

In compliance with this, Caixa released, in January 2022, the "Report on remuneration paid to men and women 2021", whose objective was to diagnose, identify and analyze remuneration differences in Caixa Group entities in Portugal. It should be noted that Caixa has been working on the issue of gender equality, having published the "Plan for gender equality in the Caixa Group", outlining a set of actions aimed at mitigating differences and promoting initiatives leading to the elimination progressive increase in pay inequalities between women and men.

## Application of standards relating to competition and consumer protection

Caixa Geral de Depósitos's activity is governed by the ethical principles set out in its code of conduct, furthering objectives of profitability, quality, customer satisfaction, fair prices and rigorous compliance with the rules of competition and protection of bank customers.

## Updating of norms on transparency in client relationship

CGD permanently oversees the publication of new legal and regulatory obligations, in addition to the issue of recommendations and definition of good practice by the supervisors, with the objective of adjusting its activity in conformity.

As mentioned above, several statutes were published in 2021. They included, inter alia, the continuing need to adapt to the pandemic in force since 2020, in terms of CGD's labour activities, in addition to the legal admissibility (national and European regulations) of banking moratoria (new regulation on the issue and adjustments to existing regulations, such as the inclusion of operations in PARI and PERSI programmes).

With the aim of adjusting its performance to conform to these behavioural standards, CGD systematically analyses its practices and internal standards on such issues, identifying opportunities for improvement, to prepare for the expected legal and regulatory amendments.

## Update of the Privacy and Personal Data Protection Policy and Cookies Policy

In compliance with the GDPR and in accordance with the principle of transparency, CGD provides information on its treatment of data and, since 25 May 2018, has published information on its privacy, personal data protection and cookies policies on its website.

Owing to technological evolution and its ongoing digital transformation, CGD continued in 2021 to disclose information and update its policies to strengthen the data protection information of personal data subjects, taking into account the circumstances deriving from the pandemic which have fuelled digital and remote contacts.

This revision, as in 2020, was publicised as part of a wide-ranging communication campaign that, in addition to CGD's website, includes personal communications sent to data subjects and other stakeholders.

## Corporate personal data protection policy

The personal data protection policy currently in force, which came into effect on 25 May 2018, sets out the principles, legal and regulatory rules, operating procedures and good practice in CGD and CGD group, for their treatment of personal data as part of their activity.

CGD's Personal Data Protection Policy, was published on 20 December 2021. The third release of this Regulation (COR OS 11/2018 (V3) - PT) updates several aspects deriving from the evolution occurring since the full application of the GDPR.

19 April 2022 was the deadline for CGD group entities to complete the internal transposition processes of this corporate standard into their internal regulations. A significant number has already started work on this process and interaction with the data protection officer for the purpose of validating the transposition proposals.

In accordance with the principle of transparency, reference should be made to the purposes of the treatment of personal data, the duties to provide information to the respective data subjects, the procedures enabling data subjects to take up their rights, the attribution of corporate and organisational responsibilities in the sphere of data treatment and disclosure of information on the functions of the data protection officer, who must be nominated in the case of CGD.

This corporate policy is directly applicable to CGD group companies and may be adjusted as necessary or convenient based on local specificities and circumstances, previously validated by the risk management division, compliance division and authorised by CGD's management.

The personal data protection policy aims to promote a corporate data protection culture in CGD group while also contributing to an across-the-board strengthening of the commitment of members of statutory bodies and all employees to compliance with personal data protection.

# Revision of corporate standard on the governance model for personal data protection 

Internal corporate regulation 4/2019 (V2) on the governance model for the protection of personal data, was revised on 29 September 2022, to ensure the revision of several aspects arising from the evolution occurring since the full application of the GDPR.

A deadline of 29 December 2022 was set for CGD Group entities to complete the internal processes involved in the transposition of this corporate regulation into their internal standards, which has been ensured.

### 3.6.4. Disclosure duties and relationship with stakeholders

## Tutelage Function and Shareholder

Caixa Geral de Depósitos fulfils the special information duties to which it is obliged, namely with the General Directorate for Treasury and Finance, communicating, among other means, via UTAM's SiRIEF system.

In accordance with Decision 1361, of the Secretary of State for Finance of 18th July 2014, CGD is exempt from publishing the information foreseen in paragraphs d), f) and g) of article 44 of Decree-Law 133/2013, having CGD extended the same interpretation to paragraph i) of the same article, given the similar nature of the information referred to.

On June 22, 2022, the minutes of the General Meeting and the Unanimous Resolution in Writing were made available on SiRIEF, contemplating the approval of the accountability documents (Including the Report and Accounts, the Corporate Governance Report and the Sustainability Report) related to the 2021 financial year.

## Institutional Investors

Under the terms defined in its legal framework, CGD, as an issuer of financial instruments, has appointed a Market Relations Representative (Investor Relations), which is devoted to assure the relationship and communication with investors, analysts, regulators and the financial community in general, namely in the following areas:

- The ongoing, consistent disclosure of information on policies, strategic pillars, financial evolution and all relevant information that CGD is obliged to disclose by applicable regulations and observing the best international practice in a context of transparency and rigor to investors, analysts, regulators and other stakeholders.

In compliance with its public disclosure requirements, Caixa Geral de Depósitos has published all relevant, mandatory information on the CMVM's information disclosure system as well as hosting it on its internet site for all interested parties, among others: the 2023 financial calendar, the disclosure of quarterly results, changes to the rating assigned and respective outlook by rating agencies and General Meeting resolutions.

- The proactive management of relations with the financial community, namely investors, counterparties and analysts. The main focus of this activity is to participate in face-to-face and virtual meetings, events and conferences, which have been replaced distance in this particular year by participation via videoconferences and calls - that allow for the opportunity to have a direct contact and to provide information to the financial community on CGD's activity and, at the same time, to assess how the perception of the financial community evolves over time. The final objective of this approach is to maintain an investor database that allows CGD to fulfil its funding plans in debt capital markets.

Various initiatives with this in mind were organised in 2022. Reference should be made to participation at videoconferences and calls with investors of the main European financial centers as well as responses to emails requesting information. At the time quarterly results are announced, a conference call is conducted by the Chief Financial Officer, providing direct and regular access to the highest levels of the bank's management. A podcast is also made available for future consultation, as hosting it on its internet site for all interested parties.

The activity developed with international rating agencies with which CGD has contracted rating services aims at providing these institutions with relevant information for their analysis which has a significant impact on financing costs paid in the capital markets. Videoconferences were held with all agencies in 2022 in which CGD was always represented by its CFO, together with other contacts for the provision of clarifications and the supply of updates.

The results achieved during 2022 were recognized by the three rating agencies who assign rating to CGD. In the first quarter of 2022, Fitch Ratings upgraded CGD's IDR and long-term preferred senior debt ratings from BB+ to BBB-, and revised its outlook from Positive to Stable. With this change, CGD became investment grade by the three international agencies that attribute its rating. In turn, DBRS affirmed CGD's rating at BBB in May 2022, having revised the trend from Negative to Positive. Already in January 2023, Moody's confirmed the deposit and long-term senior debt ratings at Baa2/Prime-2 and upgraded CGD's deposit rating outlook to "Positive" while maintaining the senior debt outlook at "Stable". These developments contribute to an improvement of the cost of funding for CGD in capital markets.

# Supervisory Entities 

## Banking Supervision

Notwithstanding the favourable development of the Covid-19 pandemic situation in 2022, the economic outlook remained uncertain. Therefore, in spite of the fact that extraordinary support measures have helped to avoid a sharp increase in bankruptcies and non-performing loans (NPLs), the quality of credit institutions' assets continued to be a cause for concern. The crisis aggravated several structural vulnerabilities, particularly related to the sustainability of business models and internal governance of credit institutions, which require prompt, effective action by them and the supervisors.

Against this background, the supervisor took several steps related to the main risks and vulnerabilities faced by institutions and redefined its supervisory priorities to enable credit institutions to 1) achieve a robust exit from the pandemic; 2) seize the opportunity to correct structural deficiencies based on effective digitalisation strategies and enhanced governance; and 3) respond to emerging risks, including climate-environmentrelated and cyber risks.

Accordingly, in 2022 and as in previous years, workshops were held with several structural bodies (DGR,GVM and DAI) on topics considered under the JST's risk assessment process, namely: market risk, operational risk, IRRBB (interest rate risk in the banking book) and forbearance. This last theme, together with OffSI \#0178817 - Credit Risk - gave rise to a set of recommendations, communicated on 15 December following the definition of supervisory priorities for 2022-2024 in order to ensure that the bank emerges strengthened from the pandemic, improving its credit risk management practice, especially with regard to the prompt identification, monitoring and mitigation of credit risks.

Pursuant to the definition of supervisory priorities for 2022-2024, CGD also contributed to a questionnaire on the effective implementation of the bank's digital transformation in the form of the SSM survey on digital transformation - whose results will be published in 2023.

CGD also participated in the targeted review of management body effectiveness, which particularly focused on the change of governance model with the beginning of the term of office of the board of directors and supervisory bodies for the 2021-2024 period.

The following main supervisory initiatives were also implemented in 2022:

- Following the fieldwork related to OffSI - Liquidity and Funding risk, dealing with the issues of liquidity and funding risk, recommendations were communicated to the bank and are currently being implemented.
- All of the recommendations identified under OffSI - Credit risk, whose fieldwork took place in 2021, focused on the bank's capacity to provide for credit risk management in a pandemic context, in addition to the supervisor's, were addressed.
- Two onsite inspections (OSIs) issued in the previous year were also completed in 2022: OSI Internal governance: Internal audit and OSI Internal governance: compliance.
- On-site field work for OSI Market risk, whose activities will continue across 2023, has also started. This OSI aims to assess the identification, management, monitoring and control of market risk in Caixa Geral de Depósitos group.

Following the outbreak of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine in February 2022, the bank adopted prudential measures to comply with the sanctions imposed on Russia by the European Union, in addition to the communication thereof to all group entities. This situation is subject to monthly oversight, in the form of a comprehensive report, which allows it to be monitored by the group's governance bodies. The issues related to the Covid-19 pandemic situation also continued to be monitored in regular reports.

Around 70 meetings were held between CGD and JST in 2022. The main topics addressed were related to the SREP decision, strategic plan and budgeting process, on-site inspections in progress and other relevant supervisory issues (forbearance, climate and environmental risk-related thematic review, BCBS 239, IRRBB, obsolete systems replacement plan). JST also held face-to-face meetings on supervisory issues with the board of directors and chairs of the special committees.

Notwithstanding the changes in the JST team and the team overseeing supervisory themes in CGD, all of the supervisor's activities in the bank and the full involvement of the teams and governance bodies continued to be guaranteed on the basis of a very close and articulated monitoring process. This enabled CGD to achieve a significant reduction in the number of recommendations issued by JST, improving its overall rating in terms of the 2022 supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) in addition to achieving highly positive ratings in other supervisory exercises such as the SSM climate stress test results.

The Bank of Portugal interacted with CGD, on a domestic level, through its normal banking regulation activity and scope of supervision over significant entities and was present in all interactions with JST.

# Banking Resolution 

As regards banking resolution, the relationship with the Resolution Authority, the Single Resolution Board (SRB) is maintained, and the continuation of the Resolution Works - the Resolvability Work Program (RWP) - in accordance with the letter of priorities sent to CGD.

The necessary works were carried out in this area, in 2022 with the continuation of the implementation of Expectations for Banks with a view to achieving, by the end of 2023, the completeness of all the principles and dimensions contained in this main requirements guidance.

According to this program, the plan and calendar established for 2022, 62 of the 64 planned activities were carried out within the initially planned date, with 2 activities being extended during the first half of 2023 with a view to their completion within the desired quality standards.

Regarding the evaluation of this Work Plan by the SRB, CGD received a very favorable evaluation that materialized in the elimination of the 8 potential candidates for substantial impediments to the Resolution and in the obtaining of 8 best market practices

The works carried out in 2022 stand out:

- In terms of the resolution plan's main instruments, the bail-in playbook, financial markets infrastructures contingency plan, communication plan and governance structures of communication in a resolution context, identification and mobilisation of collateral in a resolution context and the quantitative report on liquidity in resolution were revised;
- The dry run exercise on the resolution strategy was carried out under the management of several members of CGD's board of directors with the stakeholders being involved in the various resolution functions tested, together with the participation of the SRB and Bank of Portugal as observers;

- The annual information collection exercise, involving the need to fill in a large number of organisational and financial reporting models by CGD and other CGD group entities called to participate in the exercise;
- Work also began on the separability and restructuring aspect with the delivery of the business reorganisation plan and a study of the separability of relevant CGD group entities;
- The resolvability self-assessment exercise was also carried out in June and December for the purpose of implementing CGD's self-assessment process in terms of the evolution and progress of the implementation of the expectations for banks;
- On a MREL level, the quarterly projections were delivered as agreed and the funding and capital plan exercise was carried out at the SRB's request.

Resolution work oversight also comprised 8 resolution committees, 6 presentations to the executive committee, 2 presentations to the board of directors and 1 presentation to the Government Commission.

In terms of external interactions, CGD also participated in a series of 4 workshops with the SRB and also in several meetings with the European Banking Federation and the Portuguese Association of Banks.

Finally, it should be noted that, at the end of 2022, CGD delivered its detailed plan on the next work programme for the 2023 resolution exercise, accompanied by the necessary activities, in compliance with the 2023 letter of priorities received from the Single Resolution Board, having complied with the deliverables defined in addition to the other activities that aim to finalize the various types of resolution work in 2023.

# Insurance and Pension Fund Supervision 

In 2022, CGD, in its capacity as an insurance broker and acting as an insurance distributor, in Portugal, exclusively on behalf of Fidelidade - Companhia de Seguros, S.A., with the exception of the distribution of credit insurance in which it acts exclusively on behalf of COSEC - Companhia de Seguro de Créditos, S.A., had several interactions with this supervisory authority. Such interactions particularly included the following reports sent via the ASF portal:

- Report on the identification of persons directly involved in insurance distribution activity

In compliance with the provisions of sub-paragraph e) of no. 1 and no. 2, both of which of article 34 of the legal regulations governing the distribution of insurance and reinsurance (RJDSR), on 31 January CGD sent a list identifying the persons directly involved in insurance distribution activity that were at its service at 31 December 2021, indicating their respective adequate qualification and the establishment in which they performed their activity

- Report on the management of complaints

On 28 February, CGD, complying with the contents of no. 1 of article 40 of regulatory standard 13/2020$R$, sent a report on the management of complaints, with reference to the preceding financial year (according to the provisions of Regulatory Standard No. 13/2020-R, the Report, in 2022, was made with reference to the period from 07/01/2021 to 12/31/2021). This report is made up of two parts: the first part contains statistical elements and the second part comprises a narrative, concerning the conclusions drawn from the complaints management process and measures implemented or intended to be implemented.

- Report on the annual accounting documents for 2021

Under the terms of sub-paragraph v) of no. 1 of article 24 of the RJDSR, CGD, on June 7, sent its annual report on the accounts for 2021, in compliance with articles 52 to 55 of regulatory standard 13/2020-R.

In 2022, CGD also entered several updates on the ASF portal. They included an update of its declaration of professional civil liability insurance together with an update of its data as an insurance broker, entering new contacts to be used by the ASF for the purpose of its supervisory activity.

Regarding complaints, the ASF, whenever necessary, requested CGD to provide additional clarifications to enable it to assess CGD's performance as an insurance broker, which clarifications were promptly provided.

In 2022, inspection visits were also made to Caixa branches, and in one case the supervisor requested that the certificates of initial qualification and initial continuous training of the employees of one branch be sent to him.

# Data protection supervision 

In terms of data protection the national data protection committee (CNPD) is the national control or supervision authority, without prejudice to the possibility afforded to data subjects to directly formulate their questions or complaints to any national supervisory authorities of member states of the Union, namely those in their usual place of residence, workplace or place in which the infraction has allegedly been committed.

In 2022, in addition to the CNPD's issue of guidelines and deliberations, the relationship with this supervisory authority essentially centred on collaboration with the said authority on the requests submitted by data subjects.

CGD monitored the Activity Plan for 2022 released by the National Data Protection Commission, with special attention to the themes of (i) "the sudden implementation of a "distance" society that massively processed personal data in an online environment using solutions that did not take into account, primarily, information security"; (ii) provision of information duties to data subjects; (iii) ,the main sanctioning decisions and (iv) the opinions issued within the scope of the national legislative process, whenever there are questions of data protection.

The fact that the GDPR attributes the function of acting as the point of contact for the national supervisory and data protection authority on issues related to the treatment of data to the data protection officer, does not, however, exclude direct interaction of the person responsible for such treatment with the said authority.

## Collective bargaining structures representing workers

Similar to the practice and principles that have always guided CGD's activities, the year 2022 witnessed regular dialogue between CGD and the collective bargaining structures representing workers which are familiar with and participate in all matters coming under the scope of their intervention.

## Unions

The relationship with the Unions, in 2022, particularly included negotiations on wage scales for 2021 and 2022, oversight of various issues related to the professional situation of workers as Union members and the presentation of the 2021/2024 strategic plan. Additional and exceptional measures for workers designed to mitigate the social impacts of the current inflationary environment were also articulated with the Unions.

Twenty two meetings were held with the Unions in 2022: 10 with STEC as the company's most representative workers' Union, 4 with Mais Sindicato/SBC/SBN, 5 with SinTAF and 3 with SNQTB/SIB.

## Workers' committee

In accordance with its legal obligation deriving from the labour code, CGD's executive committee meets with the workers' committee on a monthly basis for discussions and analyses of matters related to its remit, providing the workers' committee with an advance copy of the proposed agenda.

Eleven meetings were held between the workers' committee and the executive committee in 2022.
Dialogue with the workers' committee, however, is by no means limited to its monthly meetings with the executive committee. All areas of the bank, particularly DPE as CGD's employee management and development division are available for the provision of various clarifications and information or to discuss the situations of various workers, always within the committee's scope of intervention. In addition to the eleven meetings with the executive committee another 12 meetings with CGD divisions also took place, without a management presence.

CGD workers' committee comprises 11 acting members, with 6 full-time members having been authorised for the current term of office (2021/2025).

The main topics discussed with the workers' committee in 2022 are listed below;
a) Staff contingent;
b) Performance of management control;
c) Branch office network (organic structure, branch office closures, staff contingent, new branch office layout and equipment);
d) Oversight of pre-retirement programmes and mutually agreed redundancies;
e) Performance management system (SGD) - oversight of the evaluation process on workers and changes to the SGD;

f) Presentation of strategic plan for 2021-2024;
g) Application of additional and exceptional measures for workers to mitigate the social impacts of the current inflationary environment;
h) Requests for consultation and advance issuance of opinions under the workers' committee's right of participation.

# Customers 

## Customer experience

CGD considers expressions of customer dissatisfaction to be essential for the measurement of its customer experience and the process of continuous improvement of the quality of service. They result in the regular identification of opportunities for adjustments and improvements and are critical to the identification of various risks, including equity and compliance risks, in addition to improving the level of customer satisfaction. To further foster this objective and in order to achieve greater synergies, the areas responsible for processing and responding to complaints and identification and oversight of opportunities for improvement were integrated into the same unit in 2022, which unit has since been transferred to the operations centre.

Close collaboration/articulation between the units responsible for product development, support units and operations continued across the year, in addition to internal control units in order to continue to ensure the incorporation of the rectifications/improvements identified through complaints, satisfaction surveys and monitoring of service levels in such units.

The 10,748 complaints and 75 suggestions registered in 2022, totalling 10,823 instances were down 11\% in volume over 2021. The annual distribution pattern across the year was heterogeneous, with a higher concentration of the volume of complaints received in the second half year ( $55 \%$ of the total compared to $45 \%$ in the first half year).

The main topics were face-to-face services, means of payment/cash movements, deposits and credit with $24 \%, 21 \%, 20 \%$ and $19 \%$ of the total, respectively. There was an $11 \%$ reduction in the number of complaints regarding face-to-face customer service, a $10 \%$ reduction in means of payment/cash movements, an increase of $7 \%$ in deposits and $4 \%$ in credit-related complaints in comparison to 2021.

In the case of face-to-face customer service reference should be made to the proportion of complaints related to waiting times, resulting from aspects related to the reorganisation of branch offices, namely opening hours and network restructuring/optimisation projects.

The largest differences in comparison to 2021, were registered on self-service channels, with a reduction of $36 \%$. Complaints related to Caixadirecta online and financial instruments accounted for the largest proportion, which recorded growth of $33 \%$, although they continued to be relatively insignificant in terms of absolute value.

When comparing the complaints monitored by the Bank of Portugal (Complaints Book and Banking Customer Portal) with the rest of the banks, CGD recorded a growth of $7 \%$, below the $13 \%$ recorded in the banking system.

In terms of products, and comparing the 5 largest banks in terms of complaints by number of contracts, CGD is the second bank with the fewest complaints in sight deposits and consumer credit.

## Reputation

In 2022, several studies gave CGD a very positive assessment in terms of reputation with consumers who continue to recognize CGD as a reference bank.

According to Brandscore, CGD's brand reputation indicator, it maintains a very positive assessment and above the average for banking in Portugal. The indicator with the best evaluation is "Relevance", recognizing CGD's importance in the financial sector.

The emotional dimension of reputation evaluates attributes such as Admiration, Relevance, Preference and Recommendation. Since 2017, the Reputation of the CGD brand has maintained a positive evolution, superior to that of the banking sector in Portugal. According to Powerful Brand - Marcas com Valor, by the Marktest Group, the CGD brand was the Powerful Brand in the "Banks" category, for the $2^{\text {nd }}$ consecutive year. This analysis measures the

value of the brands based on indicators of Innovation, Sustainability and Purpose of the brands, and is published annually by the magazine Senado.

In addition to these studies, according to the customers' evaluation in the Brandscore study, the CGD brand maintained leadership in the evaluation of the Attractiveness to New Customers indicator, reinforced the score of the Governance indicator and confirmed the same level of evaluation in Trust, Solidity, Ethics and Transparency, attributes considered essential to the Bank's sustainability. Brandscore is a national study, carried out with individuals aged between 15 and 70 years old.

# Data protection 

The publications of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of 4 May 2016 and law 58/2019 of 8 August 2019, afford an opportunity for companies and organisations in both public and private sectors to modernise and a competitive advantage in the Single Digital Market, strengthening customer confidence levels.

As a driving force for digital transformation, the GDPR provides citizens with a stronger level of personal data protection, giving them greater control over the way in which their data is treated, forcing companies to review their internal governance and increasing transparency and accountability in this domain.

The GDPR defines a new regulatory regime and an institutional architecture based on the appointment of the data protection officer (DPO), which is mandatory in the case of banking, the creation of the European data protection committee and the articulation between it and the activity of the national control authorities.

The not always easy and obvious harmonisation with the growing level of banking regulation and articulation with the banking supervision authorities and all the more so in the unprecedented historical-economic context of the worldwide pandemic, but whose legal framework has been provided for in the GDPR, represent additional challenges to the banking sector.

The GDPR is only one of the many regulatory requirements that condition banking activity in particular and drive the change to a digital environment in terms of business processes and relationships with customers, in which personal data is an extraordinarily valuable asset for the current economy.

In data protection terms, this asset in CGD, refers to a universe of data subjects comprising 4 million customers (natural persons), 6,500 employees, 2,500 suppliers and many other stakeholders, even if the respective legal relationships with CGD take the form (in name and representation) of collective persons.

The universe of data subjects in the group is substantially larger.A successful data protection strategy and its adequate implementation are vital to business and provide for the risk of the application of extraordinarily severe sanctions, owing to the type of business group.

Data protection should take into due consideration the risks associated with data treatment activities and operations taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of such treatments.

In 2022, the data protection officer issued opinions on data protection, as part of the governance, approval and monitoring of products policy (PGAMP), clarifying interim questions or doubts on such products and services, namely in cases requiring a risk assessment on data protection.

Data Protection also monitored several strategic projects included in the digital transformation of CGD's activity, thus contributing to compliance with "Privacy by design" and "Privacy by default", structuring principles enshrined in the General Regulation on Data Protection ("RGPD").

From an information security viewpoint, the data protection officer was involved in an exercise for updating dataflows and their respective mapping, in 2022, in addition to the assessment of incident reports, in conjunction with the competent structures.

The central activities performed in 2022 also include a response to the rights exercised by data subjects, including complaints on data protection matters and contacts with the national control authority (national data protection committee).

As in the last four years, the data protection officer and data protection office, in 2022, were responsible for awareness-raising actions and training of employees whose functions involve the treatment of personal data, focusing on data protection issues in general and issues relative to the subcontracting and impact assessment on data protection in particular.

To celebrate the International Data Protection Day, which is celebrated on January 28 of each year, a piece of news was released on SomosCaixa alluding to the occasion and reiterating the importance of complying

with the principles of data processing and the responsibility of each and every one of Employees for compliance in this matter. Reference was also made to the competitive added value that the conformity of its data protection activity represents for CGD, as a catalyst for banking business and intervention in the country's economy.

Marking the 4th Anniversary of the full application of the GDPR in Portugal and in the other Member States of the European Union, the Data Protection Officer participated, as a speaker, in the Colloquium: "Data protection and the new challenges in the banking sector", organized by Banco de Portugal and the Associação Portuguesa de Bancos, on 30 May 2022, addressing the theme "Artificial Intelligence in Banking and data protection: opportunities and challenges".

Of special relevance, from an accountability standpoint, were the necessary documentary evidence for the purposes of supervision by the control authority, work involved on the implementation of conformity with the GDPR vis-à-vis the previously existing gap with national law, in addition to evidencing the innovative character of the GDPR and its specificities as well as the alterations deriving from law 58/2019, of 8 August.

The data protection officer produced the "Activities Report 2021 - Data Protection", of 22 March 2022, in order to document the endeavours to conform with RGPD, in addition to evidencing the innovative character of the GDPR and its specificities and the initiatives implemented to ensure conformity with data protection issues, to include accountability and supervision considerations.

The referred to report was submitted for the consideration of the governance, data security and protection executive board on 28 March 2022 and approved.

The work carried out within the scope of the III DPO Forum, promoted by the European Banking Federation, on July 5, 2022, as well as in the Working Group on Privacy and Data Protection constituted by the APB Associação Portuguesa de Bancos, with the purpose of discuss and monitor GDPR implementation and compliance challenges in the banking sector.

CGD is essentially compliant with GDPR requirements owing to the work performed in 2022 and preceding years. Work designed to ensure levels of conformity totally commensurate with the GDPR is still, however, in progress and all the more so insofar as conformity is, by its very nature a permanent activity of continuous improvement that oversees and can operate as a driver of business evolution.

# 3.7. Remuneration 

### 3.7.1. Competences to determine remuneration

The Remuneration Committee of the General Meeting (CRAG) is the body responsible for determining the remuneration to be attributed to the members of the board of directors and supervisory board of the company in compliance with the Remuneration Policy for the Members of the Management and Supervisory Bodies (Remuneration Policy) approved by the General Meeting, including the limits defined therein, in its fixed and variable components, as applicable.

As the body in charge of presenting to the General Meeting a proposal defining the remuneration of members of the management body and supervisory body, the said committee is responsible for ensuring compliance with the applicable legal and statutory requirements, namely as regards their remuneration policy and its implementation.

The appointments, assessment and remuneration committee, is, in turn responsible for:

- Submitting an annual remuneration review proposal to CRAG, if justified, to include discretionary pension benefits, for members of CGD's statutory bodies;
- To annually approve and/or revise as far as justifiable the corporate remuneration policy, including discretionary pension benefits, of members of statutory bodies and other employees and respective CGD subsidiaries;
- To ensure that the corporate remuneration policy is applied and complied with for all employees and all employees identified in all entities in the prudential consolidation sphere, including all branches;
- Issue a report to be sent to the General Meeting on compliance with the compensation policies in force at CGD and remuneration practices implemented at the Institution and on the incentives created for the purposes of risk, capital and liquidity management, based on the RGICSF (general credit institutions and financial corporations regime);
- To ensure the proposal, approval and prompt application of a plan containing corrective measures when periodic revisions show that the remuneration policies do not have the intended or expected effects or when recommendations for the said purpose are formulated;
- To prepare decisions on remuneration, including decisions having implications in terms of risks and risk management to be taken by the board of directors or CGD's shareholders' meeting, on the domestic and international consolidation perimeter;
- To annually assess the remuneration policies for CGD and CGD group and adopt adequate measures to ensure that they take into due account the rights and interests of customers and that they do not create incentives which prejudice the interest of customers;
- To assist and advise the board of directors on the appointment and defining of the remuneration of the board members and statutory bodies of other CGD group companies and CGD employees with a management status who report directly to the board of directors or to any of its committees (including the executive committee);
- Conduct the process of evaluating the individual and collective performance of CGD's board of directors and supervisory bord and members;
- Submit to the CRAG the result of the process of evaluating the individual performance of the executive members of board of directors, constituting one of the relevant elements on defining the variable component of the remuneration of the executive committee members.

As regards the establishing of the maximum amount of compensation payable to members of the board of directors and the supervisory board, the shareholders' meeting's remuneration committee is responsible for defining the maximum amount of all compensation payable to the members of the board of directors and the supervisory board, upon termination of their office under the terms of the law and, to the extent applicable, the remuneration policy in force.

CNAR shall enjoy the assistance of CGD's human resources function, in the annual review of the remuneration policies and shall examine the alignment between such policies and good human resources management practice, particularly as regards the adequacy of the structure and levels of remuneration needed to attract and retain human resources to meet CGD's good operating requirements, based on its issuance of opinions on such topics.

# 3.7.2. Remuneration policy for members of the board of directors and supervisory body 

The remuneration policy, approved in the form of a unanimous written resolution, on 3 July 2019, is applicable to CGD's statutory and supervisory body.

The Remuneration Policy in force reflects adjustments made following a set of recommendations addressed by the Supervisor in November 2019 and August 2020, which resulted in adjustments addressing ex-ante and ex-post risk in the process of awarding variable remuneration, in assessing performance and risk, as well as their alignment with CGD's strategy, among others. The proposed Remuneration Policy for the Members of CGD's Management and Supervisory Bodies was sent to the Supervisor, who concluded that the changes introduced were in line with his recommendations. Notwithstanding that CRAG in office at the time had the proposal for the revision of the Remuneration Policy to the shareholder's appreciation, to date its approval has not been verified, so the text of the updated Policy has not yet entered into force and has not produced its effects. When approved by the shareholder, the final text will be published on CGD's institutional website.

The remuneratory policy of CGD's statutory bodies is governed by the RGICSF ("Legal Framework of Credit Institutions and Financial Companies"), Community standards and Bank of Portugal regulation, which establish mandatory rules and restrictions on the referred to policy.

The following are the primary objectives of the remuneration policy for CGD's management and supervisory bodies:

- To ensure compliance with the applicable, legal and regulatory dispositions;
- To promote and be coherent with healthy, prudent risk management;
- To discourage risk-taking at levels higher than those defined and tolerated by CGD;
- To ensure compatibility between the remuneration mechanisms defined and CGD's long term strategy, objective, values and interests, as established by its competent Statutory Bodies;
- To ensure that there is no situations of conflicts of interest;
- To structure remuneration mechanisms which take into account and which are adequate and proportional to the type, characteristics, dimensions, organisation and complexity of CGD's activities;
- To promote the competitiveness of CGD, taking into consideration the remuneration policies and practices of other banks and institutions comparable to CGD.


### 3.7.3. Remuneration structure

The remuneration and its respective composition are in order to permit alignment between interests of members of the management boards and the company's long term interests with CGD's governance structure and alignment with the defined risk tolerance profile for the institution.

The remuneration of executive board members comprises a fixed and variable component, the latter attribution of which is not guaranteed.

The fixed remuneration component comprises a sufficiently high proportion of the executive board members' total remuneration, to permit the application of a fully flexible policy relative to the variable component, including the possibility of the non-payment thereof.

The variable component is indexed to the achievement of concrete, qualified objectives and qualitative criteria and in line with CGD's long term interests.

The remuneration of non-executive Board members, in addition to members of the supervisory body exclusively comprises a fixed component and does not include any variable component nor is the attribution thereof contingent upon CGD's results. In both cases, attendance fees are paid for their presence at meetings of the Special Committees of the Board of Directors within an established limit value.

# Variable remuneration component 

The total variable remuneration of the executive board members as a whole may not exceed the maximum percentage of consolidated net profit for the year as defined each year by the shareholders' meeting following the proposal submitted by CRAG, with the said amount taking into account: CGD's capacity to maintain a solid own funds basis, CGD's performance and global profit, evolution of the global amount defined for the variable remuneration of CGD employees as a whole and the best practice of other banks and institutions comparable to CGD.

The variable component of the remuneration of the executive board members comprises:
a) A cash payment ("CVRN") comprising $50 \%$ of the total amount of the variable component; and
b) A payment in kind ("CVRE") comprising $50 \%$ of the total amount of the variable component.

CVRE compliance is carried out by issuing Commercial Paper, in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory framework.

Performance is assessed:

- Under a pluriannual framework, for the assessment process to be based on long term performance and for the payment of the remuneration components thereon dependent to be spread over a period which takes CGD's underlying economic cycle and its business risks into account and which should, for the said purpose, consider not only the year referred to by the variable component but also the preceding years of the term of office in progress;
- Based on the following quantitative criteria measured by the evolution of the performance of CGD's current strategic plan, the risk appetite statement approved for the Group, namely:
a) Solvency, including weighted capital and leverage ratios, internal capital sufficiency and MREL;
b) Profitability, including return on equity (ROE) and risk adjusted return on capital (RAROC), return on assets and evolution of net interest income;
c) Efficiency: cost-to-income ratios;
d) Market position: CGD's market shares;
e) Assumption of credit risk: non-performing loan ratios and respective impairment coverage and cost of risk; levels of credit risk concentration and evolution of the repossessed real estate portfolio on credit recovery;
f) Liquidity: balance sheet loans-to-deposits ratio and level of funding from the European Central Bank.
- The following qualitative criteria are also be considered:
a) Level of customers' complaints;
b) CGD's reputational indicators.
c) Qualitative performance indicators associated with each of the divisions and business areas for which each of the executive board managers is responsible.


## Deferral of payment of the variable component of remuneration

The total amount of the variable component of the remuneration to be attributed to executive board members, based on their performance, will be decided by a proposal from CRAG, at the annual shareholders' meeting or a subsequent shareholders' resolution ("attribution date"), according to the

dispositions of the remuneration policy in conformity with the other rules established by the shareholders' meeting.

To ensure harmonization between incentives for executive board members and CGD's long term interests:
a) The deferred part of the attribution of each part of the variable component of the remuneration, depends upon the fulfilment of the access condition (as defined in the remuneration policy) calculated by reference to the relevant year to be verified by the annual shareholders' meeting or a subsequent shareholders' resolution as proposed by CRAG;
b) $50 \%$ of the CVRN subject to the deferral period of 5 years from the attribution date is subject to the fulfilment of the access condition and reduction and reversion mechanisms in accordance with the remuneration policy and the guidelines in force;
c) The CVRE is subject to a retention period of 1 year starting from the acquisition thereof and reduction and reversion mechanisms, with $50 \%$ of the respective amount also being subject to the deferral period and the fulfilment of the access condition.

Provided that the access condition has been met, with reference to the relevant year and without prejudice to the applicable reduction and reversion measures:
a) The CVRN attributed is considered to have been acquired and is paid as follows:

- $50 \%$ on the acquisition date, payable up to the end of the following calendar month;
- $50 \%$ during the deferral period, in a proportion of $1 / 5$ on each of the attribution date's anniversaries, payable on the date upon which it is considered to have been acquired.
b) The CVRE attributed is considered to have been acquired and the instruments will be delivered under the following terms and in accordance with the conditions established in a separate document:
- $50 \%$ is considered to have been acquired on the attribution date with the instruments being delivered up to the end of the retention period;
- $50 \%$ is considered to have been acquired during the deferral period in a proportion of $1 / 5$ on each of the attribution date's anniversaries, with the instruments being available up to the end of the retention period.


# Complementary pension or early retirement regimes for board members 

The remuneration policy provides for executive board members to enjoy social benefits in accordance with the terms defined by the shareholders' meeting or CRAG, taking into account the practice which has been followed by CGD, in addition to the remuneration policies and practice of other banks and institutions comparable to CGD.

Non-executive board are not entitled to any specific benefits for which CGD may be responsible.

### 3.7.4 Staff remuneration policy

The remuneration policy for CGD's employees takes the form of collective bargaining agreements which are published in the Labour and Employment Bulletin and internal regulations accessible to all workers.

Corporate internal regulation 07/2020 on the "Remuneration Policy for CGD Group Employees" came into force on 14 February 2020 and was transposed into CGD group entities.

CGD group's employee remuneration policy, was revised by internal regulation 3/2021, following a series of recommendations by the supervisor, in November 2019 and August 2020 and the adjustments identified, concerning the classification of employees whose activity has an impact on CGD's risk profile, ex-ante and ex-post risk adjustment (clarification of the application of reduction and reversal criteria) as part of the process for the award of variable remuneration, the role of the internal control functions and special committees (except CNAR), the performance and risk assessment process, as well as their alignment with CGD strategy and the specific criteria applicable to key functions holders were introduced. CGD group's proposed employee remuneration policy was approved by the board of directors at its meeting of November

26, 2020 and sent to the supervisor, who concluded that the alterations were in line with its recommendations. CGD group's employee remuneration policy has been published on its institutional website. The process of transposing it to CGD group entities (including branches) in order to ensure harmony in the application of the rules in the context of the group is in progress.

The policy set out in internal regulation 3/2021 is applicable to CGD group employees and seeks to help group entities achieve CGD's objectives and values, taking into account their risk appetite, based on the adoption of sound, prudent remuneration practice, promoting solid, effective risk management within the group's corporate structure and providing its employees with a competitive remuneration framework aligned with best national and international market practice.

As defined in the remuneration policy applicable to the members of CGD's management and supervisory bodies, the remuneration (and composition thereof) to be allocated to CGD group employees should be consistent with CGD group's governance structure and aligned with its risk profile in conformity with its long term interests, discouraging excessive risk taking and be proportional to the size, internal organisation, nature, scope and complexity of CGD and CGD group entities' activity, the type and magnitude of the risks incurred and to be incurred and the degree of centralisation and delegation of entrusted powers.

CGD group employees' remuneration is made up of a fixed component defined in accordance with the wage scales and labour agreements in force and essentially reflects the relevant professional experience and organisational responsibility corresponding to the allocation of functions, taking remuneration practice in force in the industry and respective market into account.

In addition to their fixed remuneration, CGD group employees may receive a non-guaranteed variable remuneration component, depending on the profit made by CGD group and respective CGD entities, always pursuant to the risk appetite criteria defined by CGD's board of directors.

The amount of any variable remuneration paid to employees may not exceed the amount of their fixed annual remuneration for the purposes of ensuring that the fixed component represents a sufficiently high proportion of total remuneration.

The criteria for assessing the individual variable component of remuneration are based on CGD's, its units' and employees' performance.

Group employees' remuneration policy also considers the allocation of business and credit recovery incentives for employees who perform duties in the business and credit recovery divisions, eligibility for which is dependent upon verification of compliance with a set of legal and regulatory dispositions and validation by the risk and compliance functions, in conjunction with the human resources function, approved by the executive committee, after CNAR has been consulted.

As referred to above, internal regulation 3/2021 sets out in a single document the rules applicable to the identification and allocation of variable remuneration, in addition to ensuring that the deficiencies previously identified by the Joint Supervisory Teams - ECB Banking Supervision (JST) are corrected.

Following the publication of the group workers' remuneration policy in corporate internal regulation 03/2021 and in order to finalise a last recommendation - performance and risk measurement process - identified by JST, CGD undertook to attach an autonomous document clarifying the process for calculating variable remuneration to the remuneration policy, ensuring alignment with the performance evaluation, revising internal regulations defining the commercial incentives model and performance management system.

On 23 November 2020 CGD submitted a draft document to JST and on 25 January 2021 JST considered the recommendation implemented, pursuant to CGD's undertaking to conclude and approve the document.

The memorandum systemising the procedures in respect of the performance and potential award and internal regulation 21/2022 - management of performance and performance model - as proposed to JST was approved on 29 September 2022 and published on 30 September 2022.

Internal regulation 22/2022 annexed to GCGD's remuneration policy - commercial incentives system was approved on 27 October 2022 and published and sent to JST on 31 October 2022.

Within the framework of the remuneration policy, the company agreement and internal regulations govern, inter alia, the following issues:

- Wage scales and pecuniary clauses;
- Professional careers;
- Remuneration system;

- Performance management system;
- Labour conditions;
- Welfare regime;
- Incentives system.

The remuneration of CGD workers comprises a fixed and variable component which is not guaranteed.
The fixed remuneration defined under the terms of the Company Agreement in force and current internal regulations, comprises a basic wage complemented by various remuneratory items such as continuity payments, subsidies for the absence of fixed working hours, subsidies for certain functions and holiday and Christmas bonuses.

Variable remuneration is paid on a case-by-case basis by the board of directors and is contingent upon the profit made by CGD group and CGD. It is based on the performance of CGD group, CGD and their employees and is closely linked to performance appraisals and level of fulfilment of objectives.

The Performance Management System consists of an annual process by means of which CGD plans its activity, monitors performance and evaluates results. The assessment of performance and fulfilment of objectives are relevant factors to be taken into consideration in any change to the remuneratory status of workers, including managerial staff, either in the form of merit-based promotion or the revision of other fixed or variable wage components.

In 2022, the salary mass increased by $2.4 \%$, and the inflation rate of $8.1 \%$, with promotions involving $19 \%$ of the total domestic perimeter employees. The attribution of commercial incentives was also maintained, having been decided to award a Performance and Potential Award that involved around 85\% of the employees of the aforementioned Perimeter, which, as a whole, represented 16.3 million euros.

In December an extraordinary payment of 900 or 600 euros was attributed to employees with remuneration lower than 2,700 euros to mitigate the effects of the unexpected increase in inflation.

The minimum amount of the total monthly remuneration paid by CGD in 2022 was 1,359 euros. The average remuneration in 2022 was 2,501 euros, with 5,599 euros for employees with managerial functions and 2,402 euros for those who do not have managerial functions.

At 31 December 2022, CGD employees' pension fund as calculated by the fund manager was worth €3,307 million. The mandatory minimum requirement to fund $100 \%$ of liabilities to pensioners was exceeded and at least $95 \%$ by assets ( $146.7 \%$ ). Compliance with this liability was positively influenced by the positive evolution of the discount rate ( $1.35 \%$ to $3.6 \%$ ).

CGD transferred all pension fund liabilities to Caixa Geral de Aposentações in 2023, having extinguished and liquidated the fund and paid financial compensation for the liabilities transferred to it. This operation makes it possible to reduce the risks resulting from the volatility deriving from the size of the pension fund, nature of its assets and liabilities and the accounting and prudential treatment in the bank's profit and loss statement and balance sheet.

# Variable remuneration 

The crisis deriving from the Covid-19 pandemic, with its global health and economic implications in financial markets and banking systems, has led to the adoption of monetary and fiscal policy measures in addition to significant changes to legal and regulatory frameworks across all sectors of activity, particularly banking. To this end, on 27 March 2020, the European Central Bank (ECB) recommended that no dividends should be paid and no irrevocable dividend payment liabilities should be assumed by credit institutions for the financial years 2019 and 2020 up until at least 1 October 2020 and that credit institutions should refrain from repurchasing shares for shareholder remuneration purposes ${ }^{11}$. On 27 July 2020 the said entity conveyed a similar understanding to credit institutions, considering the high level of uncertainty owing to the pandemic and the consequent need to extend the suspension of the payment of dividends until 1 January 2021, indicating that additional guidance on the distribution of results for the year 2020, taking place after that date would be provided in fourth quarter 2020. In the form of an open letter sent to the banks on 28 July 2020, the ECB also called for a maximum reduction of the payment of variable remuneration. To the extent of it not being possible to reduce the variable remuneration, it suggested that deferring this type of remuneration for a longer period of time should be considered or that it should take the form of an instrument other than cash. On 15 December 2020, the ECB extended its recommendation of "extreme prudence" in the payment of variable remuneration up until 30 September 2021, in particular as regards key function holders. After this date, there is no longer any regulatory restriction on the payment of variable remuneration.

So, in November 2022, the deferred portions for 2021 were paid in cash and in kind of the variable remuneration attributed in previous years, 2017 (cash) and 2018 (cash and commercial paper subscription, with one year retention). Remunerations paid in cash were subject to personal income withholding tax, according to the applicable rates in force. Remuneration paid in kind is subject to personal income tax at the maximum rate in force ( $48 \%$ ).

[^0]Similarly, on 27 May 2020, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), as the macro-prudential supervisory authority of the European Union's financial system, issued recommendation (ESRB/2020/7) aimed at supporting and strengthening the previous initiatives of different supervisory authorities, recognising the pro-cyclical role of banks and alerting to the need to maintain high levels of capital by limiting the distribution of capital and profits, until at least 1 January 2021, in order to increase resilience, promote the flow of credit to the real economy and ensure the existence of a level playing field between institutions.


[^0]:    ${ }^{11}$ On 14 April 2020, the Securities Market Commission (CMVM) issued a recommendation to securities issuers, requesting, inter alia, that principles of transparency and sustainability should be adopted in relation to remuneration, taking into account the long term interests of shareholders and other stakeholders.

# Policy on transactions with Related and Other Parties 

For the purposes of article 33 of Bank of Portugal notice 3/2020, CGD approved a policy on transactions with related parties, with the main objective to ensure that such transactions take place under market conditions, providing for those cases in which a related party would benefit from an operation which would not be advantageous or which would be detrimental to CGD. The operations are subject to approval by a minimum of two thirds of the members of the Board of Directors, after prior opinions were obtained from the risk management and compliance functions and from the supervisory body, or it may be covered by an aggregated authorization that is renewed quarterly by decision of a minimum of two thirds of the members of the Board of Directors, which is also subject to the opinion of the risk management and compliance functions and of the supervisory body.

The Policy for Transactions with Related Parties was first updated in 2022, to reflect the change in CGD's governance model, which replaced the Supervisory Board with an Audit Committee.

The initial version of the aggregated authorization approved in 2021 was revised in 2022, to include operations in which CGD intervenes as a purchaser of goods and services under market conditions, with the approval of amendments to the aggregated authorization that came into force on 1 January 2023, in order to provide an exemplary list of types of operations covered by the aforementioned mechanism and the establishment of a quantitative limit below which a certain transaction of lesser relevance is considered covered by the aggregate authorization.

## Acquisition of goods and services

Caixa Geral de Depósitos (CGD) has transparent procedures in place for the acquisition of goods and services, subject to principles of economy and effectiveness. Caixa - Serviços Partilhados, A.C.E. (CSP) is mandated by CGD to ensure the acquisition of goods and services for CGD.

## Compliance with legal guidelines on average payment periods

In 2022, the average payment period to suppliers (calculated under the terms of Ruling 9870/2009 issued by the Ministry of Finance and Public Administration which changed the formula of Council of Ministers' Resolution 34/2008 of 22 February) on an annual basis, was equal to the previous year.

This indicator represents the average number of days between the date of receipt of the invoice at CGD and the respective payment and does not provide direct indications on the level of overdue debt. As most of CGD's contracts with its suppliers have payment terms of 60 days, the result of this indicator suggests that Caixa in 2022 tended to pay invoices before they were due.

Also as in previous years, the increase in the fourth quarter is not directly related to a greater delay in payments in that quarter, but to the increase in invoicing volume (in amount and quantity), in that period which, applying the calculation methodology defined in the Dispatch, (which foresees the division of the value owed at the end of the quarter in relation to the total value of invoicing for that quarter), results in this outcome.

|  | 2021 |  |  | 2022 |  |  | Annual average change |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Quarter | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th |
| Payment period (days) | 30 | 36 | 26 | 42 | 44 | 31 | 22 | 42 |

CGD has a mandate agreement with Caixa Serviços Partilhados, which includes, inter alia, the provision of services related with billing and the processing of payments for the supply of goods and services.

CSP has implemented an invoice processing system enabling the identification of discrepancies over the performance of services, amounts invoiced and the absence of obligatory elements to be set out on invoices.

As a means of increasingly improving the efficiency of this process and with the objective of reducing payment delays, a mass migration strategy for CGD suppliers to electronic invoicing was initiated in 2019. At the end of 2022, more than half of CGD's supplier invoices were received in electronic format.

In addition, the CSP has actively invested in the optimization and standardization of processes related to billing management, and in reducing the time associated with the approval of bills by CGD areas that manage the respective contracts/services.

These actions have allowed for a significant reduction in the time interval between receipt and processing of invoices at CGD, streamlining and dematerialization of the procedures associated with the handling of invoices, and thus better contributing to compliance with payment deadlines agreed with suppliers.

# Compliance with legal guidelines on a public contracting level 

## Public Contracting Rules

Without prejudice to the fact that CGD is a commercial company in the form of an exclusively state-owned limited liability company, it is governed by private law and is not subject to the public contracts code approved by Decree-Law no.18/2008 of 29 January, which sets out the rules on public contracts and the substantive regime of public contracts of an administrative type.

In the same way CGD is not bound to subscribe for the national public procurement system (SNCP), including its BASE system, because it is a commercial company, with the object of performing a banking activity in the broadest terms permitted by law.

CGD operates in the market in due compliance with the objectives and principles of legality and business ethics defined for the state's corporate sector as defined by Decree-Law no.133/2013 of 3 October, amended by law 75-A/2014 of 30 September which covers, inter alia:

- Transparency;

| No. vehicles | 1.296 | 873 | 812 | 810 | 804 | 817 | 785 |

CGD has been reducing the number of vehicles ( 511 vehicles less than in 2016 (-39.4\%)), with the application of the new vehicle allocation policy (approved in 2017). This initiative aims to reduce costs, especially in terms of regarding the management of vehicles and business trips, pointing to an even more responsible and environmentally sustainable use of the CGD Group's vehicle fleet.

In this regard, measures for centralized management and optimization of processes related to the acquisition, allocation and use of service vehicles continue to be adopted both at CGD and within the scope of CGD Group companies headquartered in Portugal.

## Operating expenses

With the 2021-2024 Strategic Plan, a strategy was maintained in terms of Employee costs focused on retaining and attracting talent through more training and higher awards, and in terms of General Administrative Expenses in enabling the transformation to overcome inflationary pressure.

In 2022, the focus on continuing to improve operational efficiency materialized in the implementation of a set of Plan initiatives, of which:

Optimisation of employee costs:

- Completion of the convergence process between public pension systems based on the transfer of the liabilities of Caixa Geral de Depósitos to Caixa Geral de Aposentações, at 31 December 2022;
- Adjustment to employee complement via retirement-based exits, early retirements and voluntary redundancies (without the need to replace employees) and hirings based on the need to requalify and refresh structures;
- Greater linkage to performance for defining the variable component of remuneration with a review of the performance appraisal process geared to teamwork ( $360^{\circ}$ ) and CGD's strategic priorities;
- Continued optimisation of employee management to achieve the right balance between face-toface and remote customer service and between the branch office network and central departments on an outsourcing basis, namely by internalizing application support functions.

Operational Efficiency Gains:

- Use of electronic procurement tools to reduce the acquisition costs of goods and services with the access and introduction of greater competition on a level of suppliers;
- Review and negotiation of key supply and service contracts, namely contracts related to information systems and technologies, in terms of scope, support mechanisms and agreed service levels;

- Cost-to-serve reduction based on a $7.7 \%$ increase in the number of active digital customers and provision of ATM and digital assistant (app) based unblocking services for Caixadirecta contracts;
- Increase in the number of virtual teller machine (VTM) operations with basic coin withdrawal and deposit functions in 2023 in order to reduce cost-to-serve;
- Outsourcing of the Caixa Contact Centre's information services based on a reduction of computer equipment costs and space occupancy in Caixa's head office building;
- Reduction of needs to outsource services through in-house training in the customer journey mapping area and user experience;
- Optimisation of loan approval workflows and immediate decision-making processes by improving the level of decision-making and processing time in terms of customer service;
- Paperless procedures for a series of branch offices processes to simplify customer service in terms of subscriptions for investment products and insurance;
- Investment in robotic process automation Robotic Process Automation (RPA), with a significant impact in reducing processing times;
- Improvement of processes allowing activities to be integrated in the operations centre and obtaining greater operating efficiency.

The initiatives envisaged for the effective reduction of Caixa group's administrative overheads are as follows:

- Improvement of process for defining requirements and procurement strategy for relevant purchases to improve the adequacy of spending to CGD's effective needs;
- Improved monitoring of the implementation and impact capture on key investments and implementation of the cost-to-serve oversight model;
- Harmonisation and centralisation of Caixa group procurement with the aim of capitalising on the synergies resulting from the centralised negotiation and acquisition of goods and services in Caixa group;
- Implementation of a new physical distribution model, with new branch office formats and partnership models, increasing the number of machines (VTM) accompanied by across-the-board cost reductions (rents, electricity, facility services, vehicles, ATMs/VTM, etc.);
- Negotiation of real estate rents and optimisation of space occupancy with the release of excess spaces requirements;
- Review and negotiation of insurance contracts;
- Optimisation of the costs of Caixa's vehicle fleet (number, type and scope of related services);
- Implementation of energy efficiency measures;
- Installation of 80 photovoltaic panel electricity generating units for own use;
- Review and simplification of the documentary management process, including archives, with cost reductions based on the negotiation of new contracts;
- Reduction of the costs of production and mailing of correspondence;
- Simplification of product portfolios (cards, mortgage loans, consumer credit);
- New series of digital end-to-end applications for cards, "immediate" consumer credit, investment products and insurance.

# 3.11.2 Statement of compliance - IPCG Code 

## Statement of Compliance with the Corporate Governance Code of the Portuguese Institute for Corporate Governance (IPCG)

CGD is a public company whose share capital is held solely by the Portuguese State. In accordance with CGD's legal framework, and in what concerns matters of corporate governance, it adheres to the guidelines for public sector companies set by the Technical Unit for Monitoring of Public Sector Companies (UTAM) and to Decree-Law 133/2013 - Legal Regime of Public Sector Companies.

Nevertheless, in this Report, CGD also strived to accommodate the principles of good governance stated in the Corporate Governance Code of the Portuguese Institute for Corporate Governance (CGC), which is applicable to entities that have issued shares admitted to trading in regulated markets. Since 2020, CGD has published in its Corporate Governance Report (CGR) the Statement of Compliance with the CGC, to emphasize its commitment to the best practices in corporate governance, which have assumed a growing role in the management of the institution.

This statement of compliance reflects CGD's governance model - "Anglo-Saxon" - structured in accordance with the dispositions of articles 278 no. 1 b) and 423. ${ }^{\text {a }}$-B of the CSC (commercial companies code) and article 3 of the RSJA (legal regime on audit supervision). Therefore, CGD's governance structure comprises a board of directors and, in supervisory terms, an audit committee and a statutory audit company, with the supervisory board having been extinguished.

From a total of fifty three recommendations, CGD considers adopted forty six and seven are not applicable given its legal status. The following table, lists IPCG's principles and recommendation regarding corporate governance contained within in the Corporate Governance Code and identifies in all cases the adoption by CGD, or the possibility that they are not applicable. The justification for the adoption of each recommendation and the reference to the corresponding chapter of this report where each theme is addressed is included in the following table.

Procedures should be adopted to guarantee that the member in conflict does not interfere in the decision-making process, without prejudice to the duty to provide information and other clarifications that the board, the committee or their respective members may request. | Adopted | CGD's Global Policy for the Prevention and Management of Conflicts of Interest provides that members of the management and supervisory bodies are fully aware that they cannot intervene in the assessment and decision of operations in which their spouses are directly or indirectly interested, or people with whom they live in a de facto union, relatives or similar in $1^{\text {st }}$ degree, or societies or others. | Chapter <br> 3.5.3 |
| I. 5 Related party transactions |  |  |  |
| Principle: Due to the potential risks that they may hold, transactions with related parties should be justified by the interest of the company and carried out under market conditions, subject to principles of transparency and adequate supervision. |  |  |  |
| I.5.1. The managing body should disclose in the corporate governance report or by other means publicly available the internal procedure for verifying transactions with related parties. | Adopted | The implemented transactions with related parties policy has the main objective of ensuring that this type of transaction takes place under market conditions and providing for cases in which a related party would benefit from a transaction which would not be advantageous for CGD. The above-referred to policy has been published on CGD's website. | Chapter 3.8 |
| I.5.2. The managing body should report to the supervisory body the results of the internal procedure for verifying transactions with related parties, including the transactions under analysis, at least every six months. | Adopted | Pursuant to the Policy on Transactions with Related Parties, transactions involving Related Parties regulated in the policy, require the approval of a minimum of two thirds of the Directors present at the meeting of the Board of directors to consider the matter, after obtaining the non-binding opinions of the supervisory body, the Compliance Department and the Risk Management Department. | Chapter 3.8 |

# Principles: 

II.A. As an instrument for the efficient functioning of the company and the fulfilment of the corporate purpose of the company, the suitable involvement of the shareholders in matters of corporate governance is a positive factor for the company's governance.
II.B. The company should stimulate the personal participation of shareholders in general meetings, which is a space for communication by the shareholders with the company's boards and committees, and for reflection about the company itself.
II.C. The company should implement adequate means for the participation and remote voting by shareholders in meetings.
II.1. The company should not set an excessively high number of shares to confer voting rights, and it should make its choice clear in the corporate governance report every time its choice entails a diversion from the general rule: that each share has a corresponding vote.

Not Applicable
CGD is a public limited company with exclusively public capital, and the shares representing its share capital belong to the Portuguese State, with no restrictions on voting rights or the application of defensive measures, in particular those that provide for limitation the number of votes that may be detained or exercised by a single shareholder, individually or in agreement with other shareholders.

# Chapter III - Non-executive management, monitoring and supervision 

## Principles:

III.A. The members of governing bodies who possess non-executive management duties or monitoring and supervisory duties should, in an effective and judicious manner, carry out monitoring duties and incentivise executive management for the full accomplishment of the corporate purpose, and such performance should be complemented by committees for areas that are central to corporate governance.
III.B. The composition of the supervisory body and the non-executive directors should provide the company with a balanced and suitable diversity of skills, knowledge, and professional experience.
III.C. The supervisory body should carry out a permanent oversight of the company's managing body, also in a preventive perspective, following the company's activity and, in particular, the decisions of fundamental importance.
III.1. Without prejudice to the legal powers of the chair of the managing body, if he or she is not independent, the independent directors should appoint a coordinator from amongst them, namely, to: (i) act, when necessary, as an interlocutor near the chair of the board of directors and other directors, (ii) make sure there are the necessary conditions and means to carry out their functions; and (iii) coordinate the independent directors in the assessment of the performance of the managing body, as established in recommendation V.1.1.

Adopted

As provided for in the Board of directors' Regulations, the members of the management body promote and participate in the definition of the Institution's strategy, its main Policies, its group structure and decisions that should be considered strategic for the Institution. The governance model and the institutional and functional relationship between CGD's governing bodies have contributed to the effective development of its activity, without constraints and with autonomy for the exercise of its functions. In this context, the Chairs of the Special Committees of the Board of directors (nonexecutive members) and the Chairman of the Board of directors meet monthly to analyse and discuss matters related to CGD's internal governance and the matters within the competence of each Special Commission, maintaining a fluid and regular interaction, there being no need to designate a coordinator to act as interlocutor with the Chairman of the Board of directors.

The Board of directors is made up of an adequate number of members, taking into account, in particular, the structure and size of the Institution and the complexity of the risks inherent in its activity. Non-Executive Directors perform supervisory activities and continuous assessment of the Company's management, guaranteeing the effective capacity to monitor, supervise and evaluate the activity of the executive members, thus fulfilling, with efficiency and effectiveness, the duties assigned to them.

COD's Board of directors (CA) is composed of nine non-executive members and eight executive members.

## Chapter

3.5.2
3.5.2
3.5.1 In any case, the number of nonexecutive directors should be higher than the number of executive directors.

Adopted
COD's Board of directors (CA) is composed of nine non-executive members and eight executive members.

| Recommendations | Recommendation Compliance: <br> Adopted <br> Not Adopted <br> Not Applicable | Observations | Description in Report |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| III.4. Each company should include a number of non-executive directors that corresponds to no less than one third, but always plural, who satisfy the legal requirements of independence. For the purposes of this recommendation, an independent person is one who is not associated with any specific group of interest of the company, nor under any circumstance likely to affect his/her impartiality of analysis or decision, namely due to: <br> i. having carried out functions in any of the company's bodies for more than twelve years, either on a consecutive or nonconsecutive basis; <br> ii. having been a prior staff member of the company or of a company which is considered to be in a controlling or group relationship with the company in the last three years; <br> iii. having, in the last three years, provided services or established a significant business relationship with the company or a company which is considered to be in a controlling or group relationship, either directly or as a shareholder, director, manager or officer of the legal person; <br> iv. having been a beneficiary of remuneration paid by the company or by a company which is considered to be in a controlling or group relationship other than the remuneration resulting from the exercise of a director's duties; <br> v. having lived in a non-marital partnership or having been the spouse, relative or any first degree next of kin up to and including the third degree of collateral affinity of company directors or of natural persons who are direct or indirect holders of qualifying holdings, or <br> vi. having been a qualified holder or representative of a shareholder of qualifying holding. | Adopted | Assessment of compliance with the independence requirements for CGD's nonexecutive board members is verified in the annual reassessment process on suitability and whenever there is any awareness of facts which could have an impact on it, in accordance with the legal dispositions of the commercial companies code, general credit institutions and financial corporations regime, internal regulations on this matter in force in CGD, S.A. of which reference should be made to the suitability policy for the assessment of the selection of members of the management and supervisory bodies, key function holders and managers of branches abroad and the succession plan, in line with good corporate governance practice and the recommendations of IPCG's corporate governance code. | Chapter <br> 3.5.2 |
| III.5. The provisions of paragraph (i) of recommendation III. 4 does not inhibit the qualification of a new director as independent if, between the termination of his/her functions in any of the company's bodies and the new appointment, a period of 3 years has elapsed (cooling-off period). | Not Applicable | There are no Administrators in these conditions. | Chapter <br> 3.5.2 |
| III.6. The supervisory body, in observance of the powers conferred to it by law, should assess and give its opinion on the strategic lines and the risk policy prior to its final approval by the management body. | Adopted | The supervisory body is responsible for assessing and expressing an opinion on the company's strategic guidelines and risk policy, supervising the quality and effectiveness of the risk management, internal control and internal audit systems and supervising the performance of functions in the internal audit and | Chapter <br> 3.5.2.3 |

| Recommendations | Recommendation <br> Compliance: <br> Adopted <br> Not Adopted <br> Not Applicable | Observations | Description in Report |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  |  | internal control system prior to their final approval by the board of directors. |  |
| III.7. Companies should have specialised committees, separately or cumulatively, on matters related to corporate governance, appointments, and performance assessment. In the event that the remuneration committee provided for in article 399 of the Commercial Companies Code has been created and should this not be prohibited by law, this recommendation may be fulfilled by conferring competence on such committee in the aforementioned matters. | Adopted | Without prejudice to the maintenance of responsibility for the exercise of the respective powers as a corporate body, the Internal Regulations of the Board of directors provide for the possibility of setting up special permanent commissions, composed of some of its non executive members, whenever deemed convenient and appropriate, delegating the exercise to them. certain specific functions. Among CGD's Special Committees, there are, in line with recommendation III.7, the Governance Committee and the Appointments, Evaluation and Remuneration Committee. | Chapter <br> 3.5.1.2 |
| Chapter IV - Executive management |  |  |  |
| Principles: <br> IV.A. As way of increasing the efficiency and the quality of the managing body's performance and the suitable flow of information in the board, the daily management of the company should be carried out by directors with qualifications, powers and experience suitable for the role. The executive board is responsible for the management of the company, pursuing the company's objectives and aiming to contribute towards the company's sustainable development. <br> IV.B. In determining the number of executive directors, it should be taken into account, besides the costs and the desirable agility in the functioning of the executive board, the size of the company, the complexity of its activity, and its geographical spread. |  |  |  |
| IV.1.

# 4.1. About this report 

Caixa Geral de Depósitos, S.A. (referred to as Caixa throughout this document), hereby publishes the annual corporate sustainability report concerning its activity in 2022.

The quantitative data contained herein refer to the period from 1 January to 31 December 2022, including, where relevant, information related to previous years so as to provide an overview of the way Caixa's performance has progressed throughout the years.

The information reported on sustainability refers mainly to Caixa's banking activity in Portugal and includes also information on Caixa Gestão de Ativos Sociedade Gestora de Fundos de Investimento, S.A., Caixa - Banco de Investimento, S.A., Caixa Serviços Partilhados, ACE, Culturgest - Fundação Caixa Geral de Depósitos and Serviços Sociais da Caixa.

In order to provide an insight on corporate sustainability performance, relevant quantitative and qualitative information on environmental, social and governance issues of the international structures, namely Banco Comercial do Atlântico S.A., Banco Interatlântico, Banco Caixa Geral Angola, S.A., Banco Comercial e de Investimentos, S.A., Banco Nacional Ultramarino - Macau, French Branch and Timor Branch, is also disclosed.

Acknowledging the importance of the various dimensions of Sustainability for a thorough insight on the way a company operates, Caixa has kept the Sustainability Report within its Annual Report. This sustainability reporting model aims to improve access to the available information for all stakeholders, as well as to adopt a more comprehensive approach, informing about the factors liable to materially affect Caixa's ability to achieve long-term sustainability.

The content disclosed in this report also contributes to the reporting of the sustainability requirements outlined by the UTAM (Technical Unit for Supervising and Monitoring the Public Business Sector), namely the Company's sustainability analysis in the economic, social and environmental domains and the Non-financial
![img-57.jpeg](img-57.jpeg)

Statement set forth in Commercial Companies Code.

The issues to be addressed in this report are based on the results of the materiality analysis arising from the consultation of internal and external stakeholders completed in 2021 in alignment with the development of the 2021 2024 Sustainability Strategy.

In the case of Caixa's activity carried out in Portugal, the scope of reporting is aligned with the results of the materiality obtained, while the affiliate banks report information according to their reporting, monitoring and alignment capacity with the material topics identified.

Caixa takes on an active role in contributing to the Principles of the UN Global Compact and to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The indicators and initiatives reflecting Caixa's alignment are included in the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) table.

With the aim of promoting the continuous improvement of the sustainability report, Caixa provides the email sustentabilidade@cgd.pt for readers' feedback.

The 2022 Sustainability Report was prepared in accordance with the GRI standards, including the update to GRI 1, 2 and 3 universal standards.

In a year marked by numerous climate adversities with important socio-economic impacts, meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement and the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals seems an almost impossible target to achieve by 2030. However, sustainable development has never been more imperative than in the difficult times we are living, with a war in Europe at our doorsteps, in the aftermath of a pandemic, with high inflation, rising interest rates, instability in supply chains and energy markets, which adds to political uncertainty and a succession of climate disasters.

The regulatory agenda, the energy crisis and the pressure exerted by new generations are examples of drivers of change towards a low carbon economy based on circular business models, the respect for human rights and the adoption of more transparent governance models. Recently, we have seen heat waves, floods, tornadoes and other weather phenomena impact families, businesses and cities. Climate change is already considered a major cause of disease and epidemics, forced migrations, desertification, and loss of biodiversity.

Aware of its role as an agent for change, Caixa has committed to ensure the carbon neutrality of its activity by 2050, through the setting of intermediate goals for the reduction of carbon emissions arising from its activity, including within the scope of customer financing. As a signatory to the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) commitment, Caixa has reinforced its leading role in sustainable finance in the domestic market, making an effective contribution to the balanced development of the Portuguese economy.

From an investment standpoint, Caixa Gestão de Ativos took on the commitment to align its business with the carbon neutrality goals, through the United Nations' Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, having already extended the implementation of ESG criteria to all classes of assets under management, amounting to a total of 5.9 billion euros in investment funds incorporating ESG criteria.

As the leading institution in the Portuguese financial system, Caixa plays a fundamental role in financing energy transition and a low-carbon economy, also minding the associated social impacts. Caixa's calculation of eligibility and future alignment with the sustainable activities defined in the Taxonomy Regulation is yet another step towards aligning sustainable finance policies and supporting our customers in energy transition.

# MESSAGE FROM THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER.

**Paulo Moita de Macedo**

Vice-chairman of the board of directors and Chief Executive Officer

In this highly demanding legal and regulatory context, alongside the recent expectations of regulators and supervisors in ESG matters, financial institutions face challenges requiring the transformation of their usual business models to better manage the exposure of their credit portfolios to climate, environmental and social risks and consequently become more resilient in adverse scenarios. Caixa has accordingly conducted its first stress test climate exercise and is preparing to conduct its first reporting of prudential ESG risks.

From a social standpoint, Caixa maintained its ongoing support to the community through an investment amounting to over 12.4M€, involving protocols with over 46 universities and polytechnic institutes, supporting 29 projects within the scope of the Caixa Social awards and also the Caixa Mais Mundo merit award, for 300 students enrolled in higher education institutions. Incentives for quality education have also been deployed with the support to e-accessibility, through the donation of over 300 articles of IT equipment, as well as with the employees' participation in dozens of activities on CGD's Volunteering Day.

In terms of social equity and equal opportunities, CGD reviewed its Plan for Gender Equality with measures aiming to reduce wage inequalities, formalize career progression and strengthen the processes of performance assessment and award of variable remuneration.

The path to sustainable finance is urgent and decisive. Caixa was the first Portuguese bank to issue ESG bonds and, in 2022, it has reinforced its commitment to the issue of two green bonds, for a total amount of € 800 million, proving its commitment to sustainable finance and its ambition to boost and streamline the successful implementation of the agendas for change of Portuguese companies and citizens.

We hereby renew and strengthen CGD's commitment to financing the future, supporting the fulfilment of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and the building of more sustainable, prosperous and inclusive societies.

## Strategic approach to sustainability

Caixa develops a strategic approach to sustainability, supported by a set of internal ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) policies and an alignment with the main national and international benchmarks and commitments on sustainability matters.

![img-72.jpeg](img-72.jpeg)

## Caixa - Observatory of the SDGs in Portuguese companies

![img-73.jpeg](img-73.jpeg)

The annual report 'SDG Observatory in Portuguese Companies' was an initiative developed by the Center for Responsible Business and Leadership of CATÓLICA-LISBON with the aim of monitoring the implementation of the United Nations 2030 Agenda SDGs by monitoring a representative group of large, small and medium-sized Portuguese companies.

# Goals and Targets 

In order to redirect its action and focus towards the areas in which it can effectively make a greater contribution and have a greater impact, Caixa has outlined a set of quantitative and qualitative goals that contribute to achieving the SDGs, namely:

![img-74.jpeg](img-74.jpeg)

## Caixa - Alignment with the United Nations Principles for Responsible Banking

Pursuant to its commitment and based on the Impact Analysis Tool provided by the Principles for Responsible Banking, Caixa assessed the areas with the most significant potential for positive and negative impact. The main inputs of this assessment were the specific context and challenges of Portugal as a country, and also the type of business developed by Caixa, with a special focus on retail banking activities and its level of financing exposure to specific sectors of activity. The analysis identified the following areas of impact: Job creation (SDG 8); Healthy and inclusive economies (SDG 8, SDG 9 and SDG 11); Access to housing (SDG 11); Access to education (SDG 1 and SDG 10), Climate (SDG 13) and Strong and Stable Institutions (SDG 16 and SDG 17).

With a view to aligning Caixa with Principle 2 - Impact and setting PRB targets, targets were set by weighting: a) the materiality of the areas considered critical according to the framework tool and b) the alignment with previously established targets, namely those identified in the sub-chapter 'Goals and Targets'.

The analysis developed resulted in setting targets for three areas, with the respective SDGs:

1) Job creation (SDG 8): Channeling EUR 500 M through a sustainable debt issue (maturing by 2027) to support Micro and SMEs in Portugal in economically disadvantaged areas, thereby promoting job creation and retention;
2) Access to housing (SDG 11): Financing EUR 5.9 B in housing credit, of which EUR 841 M in housing credit for properties with energy certificates A+, A and B (2023-2024);
3) Environmental impact (SDG 13): Approval and achievement of emission reduction goals by 2030, in alignment with the Science-Based Target Initiative (SBTi) methodology.

Caixa promotes the internal monitoring of these goals on a regular basis and provides additional information throughout this report on the approach process and respective results achieved.

# Main impacts on the value chain 

Based on the eight priority SDGs, an assessment was made of the main type of impact and the stage in the value chain where this impact mostly occurs. This analysis, besides allowing a holistic vision, also contributes to the development of specific projects with the aim of enhancing the positive impacts and mitigating the negative ones.

| IMPACTS ON THE VALUE CHAIN |  |  |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| SDG | UPSTREAM <br> Acquiring goods and services | OPERATIONS <br> Develop and market financial products and services | DOWNSTREAM <br> Use of financial products and services by households and companies |
|  | Economic development and job creation (through business relationships with the supply chain) | Creation of decent and quality employment as a reference employment entity | Stimulating entrepreneurship and job creation (through financing activities) |
|  | Not significant | Implementing practices of gender equality between men and woman and of equal opportunities in the organisation | Not significant |
|  | Stimulating the domestic economy and production by means of a supply chain composed mostly of domestic suppliers | Creation of healthy, safe and decent working conditions as a reference employment entity | Improving the well-being of Portuguese families and the development of the business sector through the provision of quality banking products and services |
|  | Promoting the adoption by the supply chain of more socially responsible behavior, through contractual mechanisms and engagement initiatives | Development of projects and initiatives that contribute to the financial and digital inclusion of society | Not significant |
|  | Promotion and development of more sustainable societies through purchasing practices that focus on the acquisition of materials with reduced environmental impact. | Production of energy from renewable sources in the company's buildings | Development of more resilient and sustainable cities through the use of financing lines |
|  | Promoting the adoption by the supply chain of more environmentally responsible behaviours, through contractual mechanisms and engagement initiatives | Direct environmental impact associated with the organisation's activities and operations | Indirect environmental impact associated with financing activities |
|  | Promoting responsible business practices in the supply chain, through specific contractual mechanisms | Promoting of effective, responsible and transparent management practices at all levels of the organisation | Promoting veracity, transparency and clarity principles in communication with customers and other stakeholders. |

## Caixa - National Sustainability Award in Sustainable Finance

## Prémio <br> Nacional de <br> Sustentabilidade <br> 2000000000 <br> negocios

For the financial sector, sustainable finance is one of the areas with the greatest potential for impact in promoting a more sustainable future.

Caixa's sustainable debt issuance project won the second edition of the National Sustainability Award in the sustainable finance category. This distinction reflects Caixa's trajectory and performance in terms of sustainability and sustainable finance.

# 4.7. 2021-2024 Sustainability Strategy 

The 2021 - 2024 sustainability strategy embodies Caixa's ambition to become the leader in sustainable finance in Portugal, supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy and financing projects with a social impact on people's lives.

## Stakeholders and materiality

The development of the sustainability strategy for the 2021-2024 period was based on a process of dialogue with the stakeholders, making it possible to know their expectations and concerns, an essential condition for identifying the topics considered material for the institution.

## MAIN FORMS OF RELATIONSHIP AND STAKEHOLDER EXPECTATIONS

![img-75.jpeg](img-75.jpeg)

# MAIN HIGHLIGHTS 

![img-77.jpeg](img-77.jpeg)

## Caixa - Best Bank in Sustainability

![img-78.jpeg](img-78.jpeg)

Monitoring the evolution of the Caixa brand in relation to sustainability attributes is an important tool for assessing its stakeholders' perception of its ESG performance.

In 2022, Caixa was again nominated 'Best Bank in Sustainability' and 'Best Bank in Household Support' (spontaneous nomination), improving, compared to 2021, the assessment of this indicator by customers and noncustomers.

# MATERIALITY ANALYSIS 

Caixa considers that the materiality analysis should be a tool for strategic outlining, with implications beyond the reporting of sustainability information.

To conduct the materiality exercise, Caixa used a methodological approach based on three perspectives:

- Global perspective: Analysis of key global trends, regulations and initiatives on ESG. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals are an example of this.
- Sectoral perspective: Analysis of the most relevant sectoral initiatives and guides and strategic analysis of the best practices used by companies in the financial sector. The Encouraging and rewarding Sustainability - Accelerating sustainable finance in the banking sector report of the European Banking Federation (EBF) is an example of this.
- Organisational perspective: Alignment with the organisation's strategy, commitments made, impact assessment results and key stakeholder expectations. The impact analysis performed by Caixa based on the Impact Analysis Tool provided by the Principles for Responsible Banking is an example of this.
![img-79.jpeg](img-79.jpeg)

## Corporate approach - Banco Nacional Ultramarino (Macau)

BNU Macau outlined an organisational structure and governance model to
Banco Nacional Ultramarino coordinate the ESG strategy, ensuring the alignment of the value proposition, business processes and practices and support operations, integrating sustainability principles into the Bank's decision processes.

Through a multidisciplinary internal working group, BNU is developing an action plan in order to create a materiality matrix and identify the main pillars of its ESG strategy, based on the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

# MATERIALITY MATRIX 

Based on the materiality analysis process, nine topics considered relevant to Caixa's stakeholders and to the development of Caixa's business were identified. The materiality matrix shows the relevance of each topic from a social perspective and from Caixa's internal business perspective, in Portugal, and served as the basis for outlining the 2021-2024 Sustainability Strategy and for aligning and organising the sustainability report.

# 4.8. Sustainable and inclusive financing 

The Climate Framework Law has as one of its central objectives the rapid and socially balanced transition to a sustainable economy and a greenhouse gas-neutral society.

The contribution of the financial sector as a financing pillar for economies and economic development is vital for this evolution. The financial sector should become an agent for promoting sustainable development through the advice it provides to its customers, and by developing products and services that take ESG factors into account.

However, it is also necessary to ensure that the transition process towards a carbon-neutral economy is carried out in a fair, responsible and inclusive manner, taking into account possible social risks.

## Financing the low-carbon economy

As a benchmark institution in the financial sector, one of Caixa's priorities is to support the transition to a low-carbon economy through its financing and investment activities. Considering that this is an issue with impacts on several levels (internal and external), Caixa has been developing a holistic management approach supported by several policies, commitments and other corporate documents.

The Sustainable Finance Framework stands out as a document that provides an important guideline for Caixa's financing activities in line with the principles of the International Capital Markets Association and the alignment with certain requirements of the Taxonomy regulation. The Caixa Gestão de Ativos' Socially Responsible Investment Policy, which outlines the process for incorporating ESG factors into the investment process, is also mentioned. This chapter presents a set of projects and initiatives aimed at enhancing the positive impacts and minimising the negative impacts associated with this material topic. Caixa also measures and monitors various performance indicators in this chapter and/or in Annex B - GRI Index, thereby enabling the effectiveness of the measures implemented to be assessed.

## ISSUANCE OF SUSTAINABLE DEBT

In 2022 Caixa took a further significant step towards completing its objective of achieving leadership in sustainable finance in Portugal, with two 'green' senior preferred debt issues).

The first issue was held in June and amounted to EUR 300 million, while the second issue was held in October, amounting to EUR 500 million. Both issues aim to direct the funds raised towards financing home loans with a specific environmental objective, namely the promotion of energy efficiency in housing, by financing homes with energy certificate classes $A+, A$ and $B$. Since 2021 Caixa has already performed three sustainable debt issues totalling EUR 1.3 billion.

## Caixa - Publication of the 1st allocation and impact report

In 2022 Caixa published its allocation and impact report on the first sustainable debt issue made by a Portuguese financial institution. One year after issuance, the social and environmental impact of the associated financing was estimated, highlighting:

- 5,746 enterprises supported through Covid-19 support lines ( $99 \%$ of which are SMEs in economically disadvantaged areas);
- 31,400 jobs impacted;
- 3,094,000 MWh of renewable energy generated;
- 2,115 tCO $_{2}$ e of emissions avoided related to the four buildings with minimum certification BREEAM Very Good (3rd highest level of certification);
- 470 electric vehicles financed.

For more information, see the allocation and impact report available at cgd.pt.

MZN 46,575,193 (about EUR 699,000) were financed under this line.

# Supporting social and financial inclusion

# SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENT ACTION STRATEGY 

![img-96.jpeg](img-96.jpeg)

In 2022, Caixa Gestão de Ativos strengthened its ambition to be an example in making Socially Responsible Investments, reinforcing its action approach which continues to focus on three main aspects:

1) Integration of ESG factors into investment processes, concurrent with the use of traditional financial analysis factors;
2) Engagement with the target investment companies through the exercise of voting rights associated with the assets under management;
3) Engagement with companies that fall within the realm of potential investment, fostering a close dialogue on issues of Socially Responsible Investment (Engagement).

In 2022, in compliance with a new regulatory requirement, Caixa Gestão de Ativos implemented the 'Sustainability Preferences Questionnaire' with its customers in August, requesting their feedback in terms of sustainability ambition that it wishes to see reflected in the management of its assets.

In parallel with this new questionnaire, the management company, on the one hand, updated its Due Diligence Statement, explaining the main negative impacts assessed in the management of the portfolios, and, on the other hand, in the Funds considered - Art. 8 - under the Sustainable Financial Reporting Regulation (SFDR legislation), proceeded to set a minimum level of alignment of the fund with the Taxonomy.

In line with the reinforcement of the managing company's ambition in terms of sustainability, namely in terms of exclusions, Caixa Gestão de Ativos' Sustainable Investment Policy was updated at the end of the year, limiting investment in companies with activities in socially controversial areas (a maximum of $20 \%$ of revenue), on the one hand, and new investments in issuers with sustainability rating of Caixa Gestão de Ativos below BB.

As part of the legislation in force, the annual reports of the aforementioned funds - Article 8 - now show an evaluation of the evolution of the sustainability indicators of the aforementioned Funds.

Accordingly, with reference to December 2022, Caixa Gestão de Ativos, notwithstanding the fact that it incorporates ESG criteria in the entirety of its assets, we highlight the total amount of EUR 5.9 billion in openended securities investment funds and pension funds under management that promote social and/or environmental features and comply with all the assumptions in the SRI Policy, of the Caixa Geral de Depósitos Group management companies - Caixa Gestão de Ativos, SGOIC, SA and CGD Pensões, SGFP, SA - (article 8 in light of European Regulation 2019/2088 also known as the SFDR Regulation). This amount comprises EUR 5.2 billion in securities investment funds, EUR 191 million in Open Pension Funds and EUR 537 million in UCITS Retirement Pension Funds.

The main investments managed by Caixa Gestão de Ativos under ESG criteria, classified as "article 8" of the SFDR Regulation, include the open-ended securities investment funds Caixa Ações Líderes Globais, Caixa Ações EUA, Caixa Ações Europa Socialmente Responsável, Caixa Ações Portugal Espanha, Caixa Ações Oriente and Caixagest Ações Emergentes. In addition, the open-ended securities investment funds Caixagest Obrigações, Caixagest Obrigações Mais, Caixagest Obrigações Longo Prazo and Caixa Obrigações 2025, comply with the same criteria as the offer of multi-asset funds, with Socially Responsible Investment, Defensive, Moderate and Agressive profiles of the Selection, Wealth and PPR/UCITS funds.

# Incorporation of ESG factors into the investment process 

The incorporation of ESG factors into Caixa's investment process is taken into account alongside the incorporation of traditional financial analysis factors. To this end, as a complement to the basic analysis applied, Caixa Gestão de Ativos developed an internal rating methodology called Caixa Gestão de Ativos Sustainability Rating.

This rating consolidates different analysis approaches/methodologies according to the underlying asset class in a score obtained through the weighted average of the ESG ratings of each asset by its relative weight, ranging from 0 to 10 and falling within a rating range between CCC (minimum) and AAA (maximum). In the case of investment in alternative funds and real estate funds, specific procedures related to the characteristics of the investment in question are adopted.

To calculate Caixa Gestão de Ativos' sustainability rating, the following approaches are considered according to the asset class under analysis:

- For direct and/or indirect investment (including investment in shares, bonds, money market, alternative assets) Caixa Gestão de Ativos uses an internationally renowned ESG research provider, whose analysis methodology focuses on companies, countries and investment funds, and is framed by a score that ranges from 0 to 10 and by a rating range between CCC (minimum) and AAA (maximum). Where a particular asset is not subject to analysis by this provider, Caixa Gestão de Ativos will consider the ESG rating and analysis of a comparable entity.
- In the case of Direct Real Estate Investment, Caixa Gestão de Ativos has developed an internal methodology for ESG rating of Real Estate in which each property is classified from the standpoint of sustainability, based on environmental and social indicators, and on the corporate governance component. For each of the ESG dimensions, an average score is obtained which is weighted respectively by $40 \%$, in the case of the environmental and social parameters, and $20 \%$ in the case of corporate governance, resulting in a final ESG rating ranging from 1 (minimum) to 10 (maximum). The ESG rating of each property can be used in evaluating a multi-asset portfolio, using its market value as a weight.
- In the case of investment in alternative funds and real estate funds, the goal is to have a minimum exposure of $50 \%$ of their total value to assets under the responsibility of management companies that are PRI signatories, or adherents to commitments and indicators equivalent to this initiative, in terms of commitment to Socially Responsible Investment.

Caixa Gestão de Ativos' Sustainability Rating applicable to portfolio management assumes that the portfolios will be made up of at least $85 \%$ of ESG-rated assets. These portfolios must also have a minimum weighted average ESG rating of $\mathrm{BBB}^{12}$ and no new investments will be made in companies with an ESG rating lower than BB.

Additionally, the management company, as part of its management processes, continuously monitors the Main Adverse Impacts, established in accordance with the SFDR legislation, and selected for the analysis of the managed assets, using an internal methodology, which considers the existing and recognised limitations to the quality and reliability of the information currently provided by the issuers.

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{12}$ On a rating scale from AAA to CCC (best AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, CCC worst).

# Caixa Gestão de Ativos - ESG criteria in pension funds management 

As a result of the sustainability strategy followed, the process of integrating sustainability factors as a complement to basic analysis is followed in the selection of assets regardless of the type of customer considered.

In this context, all pension funds managed by CGD Pensões, sociedade gestora de fundos de Pensões of the Caixa Geral de Depósitos Group, consolidated their sustainability approach in 2022, for a total amount of EUR 4.2 billion. Among those, we highlight the open pension funds classified as "Article 8" of the SFDR Regulation, for a total amount of EUR 191 million, namely the Open Pension Funds Caixa Reforma Defensivo, Caixa Reforma Moderado and Caixa PPR Rendimento Mais.

## Main highlights in terms of Engagement

Caixa Gestão de Ativos' approach, in accordance with its Socially Responsible Investment Policy, identifies the engagement dimension as one of the management company's main vectors of action, with the ambition of seeking to influence issuers to adopt more sustainable practices, in accordance with the management company's vision.

In accordance with the details provided in its Engagement and Voting Rights Exercise Policies, the materialisation of Caixa Gestão de Ativos' intentions in the approach followed, although intended to be as comprehensive as possible, focus more on the following situations:

- At the level of General Shareholders Meetings (GSM) with a focus on Companies, the management company took part in the most representative GSM in the context of the assets managed by the Management Company, or with the lowest overall ESG evaluation, always with a view to improving the issuer's practices. In 2022, Caixa Gestão de Ativos participated in a total of around 130 GSM's.
- Regarding Engagement with Companies, the Management Company participated, in coordination with other international investors, as part of the pooled engagement contracted by Caixa Gestão de Ativos from an external partner recognised internationally in the engagement area, to assess and ascertain identified situations which allegedly involved possible inadequate practices in terms of sustainability.

As a corollary to the strategic dimension that the Engagement approach assumed in the Management Company's sustainability strategy, a negative response to efforts it supported to correct practices considered inadequate in light of its sustainability vision was naturally a factor that negatively conditioned a potential investment in the issuer in question.

## Implementation of the Principles for Responsible Investment

Caixa Gestão de Ativos' adherence in 2019 to the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), as an internationally renowned organisation in the sustainable investment area, has enabled the management company to benefit, on the one hand, from the sharing of best practices at international level and, on the other, from the annual independent evaluation focusing on the strategic outlining, corporate governance and implementation dimensions of Caixa Gestão de Ativos, namely in the different asset classes in which it invests.

This assessment is reflected in the management company's absolute result and in its relative comparison with the other signatory management companies.

Due to the technological problems associated with the evaluations, which the organisation experienced during 2021 and 2022, the evaluations for 2021 of Caixa Gestão de Ativos were only known in August 2022.

From the evaluation received we highlight:

- The maintenance of positive evaluation, according to a new, more demanding methodology.
- Very positive results in Investment \& Stewardship Policy and Integration of ESG criteria;
- Need for improvement in reporting of the engagement approach (annual engagement report already released - January 2022); ESG information reporting to customers (improvements in progress) and additional focus on the climate dimension (improvements in progress).

# Caixa Gestão de Ativos - Jornal de Negócios/APFIPP Award 

![img-97.jpeg](img-97.jpeg)

The Caixa Ações Europa Socialmente Responsável Fund Investimento Mobiliário Aberto de Ações Fund won the Jornal de Negócios/APFIPP award for the 2nd consecutive year in 2022, as the best national fund in the 'European Equity Fund' category, rewarding the strategy followed by the Fund since 2019 of favouring, in its composition, companies that stand out in the different sustainability dimensions. This fund has been classified since March 2021 as an Article-8 Fund under the European Regulation 2019/2088, also known as the SFDR Regulation.

Jornal de Negócios/APFIPP also awarded the funds classified as article-8, Fundo Caixa Wealth Defensivo (Category C) Fundo de Investimento Mobiliário Aberto, in the 'Fundo Multi-Ativos Moderado and Caixa Wealth Moderado (Category C) category, and Fundo de Investimento Mobiliário Aberto in the 'Fundo Multi-Ativos Equilibrados' category.

## Caixa Gestão de Ativos - Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative

As regards adherence to international initiatives, in September 2022 Caixa Gestão de Ativos joined the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a global initiative officially launched in December 2020, which brings together the efforts and commitment of signatory international asset management companies to decarbonise the portfolios under management, thus contributing towards the objective of achieving zero net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

This accession process represented a natural step, as a result of the strategic commitment of the management company to face the risks and challenges associated with climate change, thus contributing to the mitigation and reversal of global warming and aligning its performance with the best ESG practices in the asset management industry.

## PARTICIPATION IN SUSTAINABLE DEBT OPERATIONS

Reference should be made to Caixa - Banco de Investimento's involvement in 13 sustainable debt operations in 2022, nine of which were in the Sustainability-Linked format and four in the Green format, namely:

- Opening Sustainability-Linked Bonds issuance of Sonae Sierra, in the amount of EUR 50 million and with a maturity of 7 years, issued in January following the publication by the company of its Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework.

- Sustainability-Linked financing for NOS, in the amount of EUR 100 million maturing in 2027, involving a bond issue and a commercial paper programme, both carried out in March under the Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework and indexed to the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from NOS' own operations.
- Four ESG-Linked Commercial Paper Programmes, in the amount of EUR 250 million, for Sonae Group companies, namely Sonae SGPS and MC Retail, linked to the performance of those Sonae Group companies in promoting the presence of women in leadership positions and reducing $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.

# Caixa - Sustainable Finance Policy 

As part of Caixa's commitment to promoting sustainable financing, it started developing a Sustainable Finance Policy aimed at establishing a set of principles and general rules to be observed in the sphere of sustainable finance at Caixa and CGD Group entities. This Policy contributes simultaneously to achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement and of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and to responding to international commitments with the Principles for Responsible Banking and the Net Zero Banking Alliance.

# Banco Comercial do Atlântico - Social Bond Issue 

![img-99.jpeg](img-99.jpeg)

Through the Cape Verde Stock Exchange (BVCV), BCA financed the first Social Bond in Cape Verde, in the amount of CVE 100 million (around EUR 906,000).

The issue is aimed at funding operations with a social scope, namely microfinancing lines of credit, covering individuals, micro-entrepreneurs and groups acting in joint liability.

It is a very relevant financial instrument for the development process of the microfinancing and social entrepreneurship axis, whose purpose is to reduce poverty, promote social inclusion, economic growth and sustainable development of the country.

This was the first sustainable bond issue in the economic-social segment in Cape Verde by a banking entity, the first social bond on the African continent and the first social bond made by a microfinancing institution worldwide (Morabi - Cooperativa de Poupança e Crédito). In addition to BCA, this project had the participation of the Cape Verde Government, the Banco Central de Cabo Verde, Morabi Cape Verde Stock Exchange, and Ernst \& Young.

## Job creation and development of the business fabric

Caixa's mission is to generate value for Portuguese society, providing quality banking services to both retail and corporate customers, hence contributing towards improving the well-being of Portuguese families and towards developing the corporate sector, ensuring the right amount of profit for the Shareholder.

In the pursuit of its activity, Caixa assumes support to the economy as one of its guidelines, by providing financing for companies, especially to promote the internationalisation and to operationalise support lines for small and medium-sized companies.

In this context, it is important to highlight the Corporate Banking Commercial Committee as an advisory body to the Executive Committee, responsible for debating, analysing and monitoring the business and commercial activity of Caixa's Corporate Network, as well as for analysing and assessing structuring initiatives with an impact on the management and commercial strategy of the Corporate Network.

This chapter presents a set of projects and initiatives aimed at enhancing the positive impacts and minimising the negative impacts associated with this material topic. Caixa also measures and monitors various performance indicators in this chapter and/or in Annex B - GRI index, thereby enabling the effectiveness of the measures implemented to be assessed.

## BUSINESS SEGMENT EVOLUTION

In 2022, a year once again marked by a scenario of uncertainties and challenges, deriving from the war in Ukraine, Caixa remained by companies' side, endeavouring at all times to support the recovery and development of their businesses and strengthening its commitment to finding the best solutions, most notably:

![img-100.jpeg](img-100.jpeg)

This line of credit, guaranteed by Banco Português de Fomento to 80\%, reinforced the range of existing solutions for the sector, helping to support the sustainable recovery of Tourism, namely by reinforcing working capital and boosting relevant investments for the respective sector. This line, aimed at Micro, SME, Small Mid Cap, Mid Cap and large companies, is available in three purposes:

- Working Capital: Financing treasury needs;
- Investment: Financing tangible and intangible fixed assets, which contribute to the development of the activity;
- Bank guarantees: Guarantees in favour of third-party national or foreign entities that ensure the proper execution of investments or events, or the fulfilment of payment obligations.


# EIF (European Investment Fund) Lines 

![img-101.jpeg](img-101.jpeg)

Caixa, as an EIF EGF Programme partner, presented to the market a plafond of EUR 2.3 billion, after a EUR 1.3 billion reinforcement to the initial amount at the beginning of the year. A significant amount that allowed corporate customers to meet investment, business transformation, working capital and treasury reinforcement needs (with particular emphasis on environmental sustainability issues).

A range of debt service solutions that enabled around EUR 1.4 billion to be placed in medium- and long-term loans and nearly EUR 700 million in treasury support, thus translating into an important result that strengthens the position and importance of European Investment Fund programmes in stimulating the domestic economy.

## Support Line for Increased Production Costs

![img-102.jpeg](img-102.jpeg)

Credit line by Banco Português de Fomento to support companies especially affected by the sharp rise in energy and raw material costs and by disruptions in the supply chain, with a $70 \%$ guarantee, which started being marketed at the end of December. Also in 2022, reference should be made to the increase in demand for corporate treasury support solutions, namely Caixa Invest Tesouraria, and for factoring and confirming solutions.

# Caixa - Main results achieved: business segment 

![img-103.jpeg](img-103.jpeg)

Caixa reinforced its business segment assistance, not only in terms of the number of customers, with 32,000 more enjoying the specialised assistance of a Caixa Negócios Manager, but also in terms of its domestic presence in markets with greater potential, enabling it to provide specialised assistance to more customers.

The increase of market share in the segment was a priority in commercial performance and around 10,000 new customers chose Caixa to back their investments or their treasury needs. More than 15,000 Caixa Business accounts were also placed. This solution includes several products, namely Caixadirecta Empresas, which allows customers to access their accounts and perform the most frequent banking operations autonomously and easily, without the need to go to a branch. This offer was reinforced in 2022 with the launch of the Caixa Corporate Account which, in addition to the products mentioned, includes 1000 free monthly transfers and an associated insurance package.

The PME Líder 2021 programme distinguished 11,221 companies, of which 3,774 with Caixa's support ( $+19 \%$ compared to 2020). As regards PME Excelência 2021, IAPMEI distinguished 3,881 companies, of which 1,074 by Caixa ( $+40 \%$ compared to 2020). The period for submitting applications for the 2022 Programme has been running since 14 November, and Caixa remains committed to supporting companies wishing to apply.

## Supporting entrepreneurship and self-employment

![img-104.jpeg](img-104.jpeg)

Caixa provides a series of microcredit solutions designed to combat poverty and social exclusion, through lines of support for entrepreneurship and selfemployment, resulting from partnerships with CASES, IEFP and the European Investment Fund. These partnerships help to speed up access to credit for a customer segment often affected by social exclusion.

These solutions include Linha Microinvest, Linha Investe+, Caixa Jovem Empreendedor, Caixa Invest Social Projeto, which have contributed towards encouraging the creation of small businesses, which are crucial for creating and retaining jobs in a sustainable way.

In 2022, Caixa handed out the awards for the first edition of the Caixa Microcrédito CASES Competition, rewarding the best business project implementation using Caixa Microcredit, with the objective of distinguishing business promoters who, with courage and entrepreneurial capacity, invested in an idea seeking to serve the market. Caixa and CASES are keen to recognise this merit by distinguishing the most outstanding businesses in a series of economic and financial areas with a direct impact on society: employability and environmental sustainability.

In line with a commitment to relevant social intervention, actions to develop microcredit options will continue to be part of Caixa's activity, endeavouring to cover the largest number of business promoters with difficulties in accessing the essential debt services for business development, irrespective of their size.

# Microinvest Line 

![img-105.jpeg](img-105.jpeg)

Microcredit is an important tool for small entrepreneurs to access the funding they need to launch their micro project or small business. Caixa's Microinvest Line supports entrepreneurship projects and the creation of self-employment through access to bank credit on favourable terms.

EUR 558,000 were financed in 2022.

## ESG action pillars for the corporate segment

Taking into consideration Caixa's ambition in terms of sustainable finance, an ESG action plan was developed for the corporate segment based on five action pillars. Two new areas were added in 2022, namely Price Differentiation and Asset Certification.
![img-106.jpeg](img-106.jpeg)

## Caixa - 2021 SME Excellence Gala

![img-107.jpeg](img-107.jpeg)

The SME Excellence 2021 Ceremony was held in December 2022. Caixa was represented by Francisco Cary, Director of the Corporate Portfolio, at the presentation of awards to Caixa customers distinguished by IAPMEI.

IAPMEI has distinguished 3,881 SME Excellence 2021 companies, of which 1,074 companies though Caixa.

## Companies platform

Plataforma de Empresas is an intuitive and user-friendly internal solution, developed for front-office and back-office users, aimed at accelerating and digitally transforming the product and service commercialisation processes for the corporate and business segment.

This platform is the first delivery of the Empresas 3.0 Programme, which is part of Caixa's Strategic Plan and aims to improve the marketing capacity of the company's products and services in terms of meeting customers' needs and resolving their pain points by redesigning the end-to-end journey flows, simplifying, automating and increasing the speed of the decision-making and contracting process.

Plataforma de Empresas provides, aggregates and systematises customer information, enabling business managers and companies to take a proactive commercial approach by preparing credit simulations and proposals, including other financial services, for immediate delivery to the customer, based on an automatic credit limit generation engine and optimised and automated workflows.

This solution guarantees greater process efficiency since it allows the manager to have a $360^{\circ}$ view of the customer, to provide credit limits with flexible use per product family, ensuring the policies and risk criteria outlined; it made it possible to carry out adequate simulation per product and a simplified price decision, enabling the automatic generation of conditions for quick proposals.

This platform is innovative because it elevates the entire decision-making process and credit contracting to another level, enabling the creation of a better relationship with the customer and of more business. This platform also allows the reduction of operational risks by eliminating manual work and automating several processes, from the integration of information originated by other systems, to the automatic generation of limits, the sending of standardised data for contracting, the automatic completion of documents without manual editing, among many other benefits.

# Caixa - Heróis PME Awards 

As an example of a project under Pillar 3 - Economy 4.0 and Training, reference should be made to Caixa's participation in the initiative promoted by Yunit Consulting 'Heróis PME Awards' (SME Heroes Awards), which aims to disseminate and reward the best innovation and entrepreneurship cases in Portugal.

The Gala for the Heróis PME Awards, where the finalists of the 4th edition of these Awards in the SME Heroes, Sustainability and Digital Transformation categories were announced, as well as the big winners, took place on 25 May.

- 39,900 visits to www.heroispme.pt;
- 18,500 votes from the general public;
- Three Heróis PME webinars (Sustainability, Digital Transformation and Internationalisation) which brought together 380 live participants and more than 2,300 views;
- Three winners (Heróis PME - General, S Factor - Sustainability and Digital Transformation categories).

# 4.9. Climate risk management 

Climate change represents a decisive challenge for humanity. From the implications of the increasing number of extreme weather events, to rising sea levels, increased flood risk and loss of biodiversity, its impacts have an unprecedented scale, making it urgent to implement effective measures to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, while promoting the reduction of Caixa's climate risk exposure.

The transition to a low-carbon economy aligned with the Paris Agreement requires a transformation of systemic economic models, underpinned by public policy commitments, laws and corporate action.

## ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS AND CLIMATE ACTION

The 2023 Global Risks Report developed by the World Economic Forum identifies environmental risks as one of the main risks on a global scale, highlighting in this context the failure to mitigate and adapt to climate change, natural disasters and extreme weather events and the loss of biodiversity as the most severe longterm risks that humanity will have to face.

Considering the financial repercussions of this type of impact, companies should develop adaptation and mitigation strategies in order to reduce and manage the risk associated with climate change.

Caixa has been strengthening the control of non-financial risks, which provides for the identification, assessment, measurement, monitoring, control and reporting of the Group's non-financial risks, which include the dimensions of emerging risks intrinsically related to sustainability, as well as a specific risk subcategory concerning the impact of climate change in the context of banking activity.

Risk management is centralised and supported by a dedicated structure, the Risk Management Division, under the responsibility of the Chief Risk Officer.

Of particular note in this regard is the Non-Financial Risks area of the Risk Management Division, which is responsible for identifying, assessing, measuring, monitoring, controlling and reporting non-financial risks, including the operational risk for the entire CGD Group, as well as ensuring the overall supervision of the CGD Group's Business Continuity Management.

In terms of the governance model, it is important to highlight the Sustainability Committee as the body that monitors the development and implementation of the CGD Group's strategic guidelines for climate action and that drives the implementation of the business strategy and the main policies with regard to climate change and climate and environmental risks.

This chapter presents a set of projects and initiatives aimed at enhancing the positive impacts and minimising the negative impacts associated with this material topic. Caixa also measures and monitors various performance indicators in this chapter, in Annex B - GRI Index and in Annex D - Response to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.

## ESG risk assessment

Climate and environmental risks are integrated into the CGD Group's risk framework, and therefore integrate the bank's risk appetite, decision-making processes and strategy.

In accordance with the Group's risk taxonomy, climate and environmental risks are a subcategory of strategy and business risk and also an additional risk factor for the other prudential risk categories, namely credit risk, market risk, operational risk and reputational risk. This will allow improving the business model's adaptation and resilience to the possible impact and magnitude of these risks.

Caixa considers that these risks comprise two essential risk factors:
Physical risk: refers to the financial impact of climate change, including more frequent extreme weather events and gradual climate change, as well as environmental degradation, such as air, water and soil pollution, pressure on water resources, biodiversity loss and deforestation. Consequently, physical risk is categorised as 'acute' when it arises from extreme events such as droughts, floods and storms, and as 'chronic' when it results from gradual changes such as rising temperatures or sea levels, pressures on water resources, loss of biodiversity, land use change, habitat destruction, and scarcity of resources. These situations can lead directly to,

for example, damage to property or a decrease in productivity or indirectly cause subsequent events, such as the disruption of supply chains;

- Transition risk: refers to the financial losses of an institution that may, directly or indirectly, result from the adjustment process towards a low-carbon and more environmentally sustainable economy. This risk can be triggered, for example, by a relatively abrupt adoption of climate and environmental policies, technological progress or changes in market sentiment and preferences.

The management of climate and environmental risks includes, for example, considering new assessment variables when Caixa grants a loan, such as greenhouse gas emissions, the energy sources used, customers' energy transition plans, the energy category of the properties or the location of the assets, given that there are regions that are more or less exposed to climate phenomena.

Caixa's response to climate and environmental risks involves optimising the bank's adaptive and dynamic capacity in the face of emerging national, international, political and regulatory developments on these risks. This effort is being made by all of Caixa's structural bodies, in a holistic and forward-looking approach.

For this prospective and forward-looking sustainability approach, Caixa has invested in the development of projections, stress tests, sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses, considering short-, medium- and longterm scenarios, as well as different transition trajectories to carbon neutrality, considering not only the transition scenario consistent with the Paris Agreement goals but also more adverse scenarios.

Additionally, in the sphere of Caixa's commitments to carbon neutrality, medium- and long-term projections have been developed for the alignment of the credit portfolio with the goals established.

These projection and scenario exercises for longer time horizons are an important contribution to understanding climate-related risks and opportunities, enabling this information to be incorporated into strategic decision-making with a view to Caixa's adaptation and resilience to climate change.

As part of the prudential expectations set out in the European Central Bank Guide on climate and environmental risks, Caixa has established an internal working group which is committed to an action plan for achieving safe and prudent management of these risks, having already completed various initiatives on this matter. This action plan includes the participation of several of Caixa's structural bodies which, on a holistic basis, guarantee compliance with the prudential framework in force for the management of these risks, in full alignment with the expectations of stakeholders for climate action and Caixa's commitments to carbon neutrality.

# Caixa - Supervisory exercises 

In 2022, the European Central Bank conducted two supervisory exercises related to climate and environmental risks, a climate stress test and a theme-based assessment on banks' alignment with supervisory expectations as well as the soundness and scope of their plans to strengthen governance and strategy to manage these risks.

Caixa's score in both exercises were highly positive, positioning the institution above the average performance of its peers.

## ESG Rating Model

Caixa's innovative culture, commitment to sustainability and the objective of evolving in order to anticipate changes and control their potential impacts have led to the development of an internal ESG Rating model.

The ESG Rating is intended to complement the financial rating information, considering non-financial aspects equally important in terms of risk impact and feasibility, contributing to a prospective view of companies' economic and financial situation and consequently to a more holistic and robust risk management.

The ESG Rating is, to a certain extent, a preview of the evolution of the financial rating from a medium-term perspective, considering that, in the medium term, non-financial (environmental, social and governance) risks will be expressed in the balance sheet and financial statements of the companies.

Aiming to ensure the maximisation of value for the various stakeholders, it is worth highlighting as an ESG Rating goal the strengthening of the customer-centred vision, creating opportunities for dialogue and awareness between commercial areas and businesses, promoting counselling and anticipation of needs, in order to better support businesses in the process of transition to a greener and more inclusive economy.

Caixa Geral de Depósitos' ESG Rating Model was implemented throughout 2021 and allowed for the assessment and ranking of about 400,000 businesses and 23 billion euros of bank loans in terms of sustainability.

The results for the first semester of 2022, considering the dimensions analysed by company, namely Environmental, Social and Governance, show it maintained an acceptable exposure to ESG risks, with a concentration of exposure at 'Good' and 'Satisfactory' levels.

2021 (Dec.) 2022 (Jun.)
![img-109.jpeg](img-109.jpeg)

In order to support commercial activity, four sustainable finance strategies (Ponder', 'Capture', 'Enhance' and 'Divest') were developed and implemented complementarily, using as inputs the correlation between the financial rating and the ESG rating, thus enabling the identification of customers with greater development and placement potential and customers at risk, with the main objective of enhancing the commercial relationship and meeting the companies' needs.

Throughout 2022, the information resulting from the application of the ESG Rating model and the methodology relating to the outlining of sustainable financing strategies has been incorporated into the following processes:

- Provision of information on the rating systems to the 1st line, specifically to the commercial, marketing and credit origination areas, to support the prioritisation and differentiation of commercial action according to customers' risk level, contributing to a holistic and integrated view of risk in decision-making;

- Provision of inputs for the 2nd line, specifically the development of the Climate Stress Test and the Risk Appetite Statement (RAS);
- Contribution to meeting regulatory requirements, namely by providing inputs to expectations 7 and 8 of ECB's Guide on climate-related and environmental risks, as well as for the Theme-based Review on C\&E Risks;
- Assessment of the physical climate risk of Caixa's branches/properties.

A new version of the ESG Rating model is under development, aiming to strengthen and update the existing model by incorporating new indicators, to be implemented throughout 2023.

# Caixa - Dissemination of the risk culture 

Caixa recognises the high relevance of contributing to disseminate the risk culture, specifically with regard to ESG risks.

To this end, 6 webinars were held with internal and external entities, called 'ESG Rating by CGD Assessing companies' sustainability'.

## SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF OPERATIONS IN THE VALUE CHAIN

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report 'Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change' reiterates that climate change is a threat to human well-being and the health of the planet referring to the need to limit global warming to $1.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and to promote changes in behaviour and lifestyle.

Caixa recognises that its activities have an environmental impact along the value chain, both upstream (through its supply chain), in its operations (considering the consumption of resources associated with the activities developed by the organisation) and downstream (based on the impacts associated with its products and services).

Acknowledging the importance of companies in the transition to a carbon neutral economy, particularly of the banking sector, Caixa has undertaken to set objectives for reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in line with science, namely for its own and financing activities. At the same time, Caixa has been investing in the development of various engagement initiatives with its suppliers to promote the adoption of more environmentally and socially responsible behaviours.

In this context, Caixa has made efforts to identify, quantify and enhance the opportunities arising from the value chain and minimise the negative impacts associated with it.

## Environmental Management System

Caixa has an Environmental Management System (EMS) implemented and certified in accordance with ISO 14001:2015 at its Head Office Building. Nine years after obtaining the first certification, the certifying entity confirmed through the external audit process the continuous improvement of the system.

Aligned with the three commitments of the Environment Policy: compliance with environmental legislation; adoption of a proactive attitude and measures to prevent pollution; and continuous improvement of environmental performance, Caixa continues to invest in initiatives which allow for the favourable evolution of the system:

- Implementation of energy efficiency measures: installation of motion detectors and conversion of the production units into microgeneration for self-consumption in about 80 facilities in the commercial network;
- Implementation of water efficiency measures: installing flow reducers on washbasin taps, increasing their water efficiency to A or A+;
- Conduct internal operational control actions: carry out operational control visits to monitor environmental requirements, processes and internal procedures;
- Promote eco-efficiency and circular economy: purchase carbon-neutral carpeting and continue the donation of goods, promoting their reuse;
- Top management commitment and involvement: revision and publication of the service order for the governance model of the environmental management system;

- Awareness-raising/Communication: integration of awareness-raising on the EMS in the safe visit to the Head Office Building and reinforcement of good practices to be adopted in training through the e-learning 'Sustainability: A strategic approach' and on Caixa's internal channels.


# Caixa - Implementing ESG Practices in the supply chain 

![img-110.jpeg](img-110.jpeg)

As part of its promotion of a responsible relationship with its suppliers/service providers and highlighting the importance of the value chain to Caixa's activity, a questionnaire was conducted to diagnose and characterise CGD's supplier portfolio. This questionnaire allowed for the collection of 81 answers and was the first step in assessing the need to review the criteria for qualifying the most critical environmental services.

In 2022, Caixa implemented also the e-procurement SAP Ariba platform, which enabled a significant change in the relationship between Caixa and its suppliers. All interactions, from registration to qualification and subsequent contracting, are now carried out exclusively through this platform. The qualification begins with the supplier being sent an evaluation questionnaire covering seven fundamental topics, of which we highlight the conduct/compliance and ESG practices.

In order to monitor performance in this area, in 2022 Caixa was assessed using the Supplier Engagement Rating questionnaire of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and achieved a Management (B) rating, above financial sector average (B-).

## Energy consumption

In the context of Caixa's activity, it consumes:

- Direct energy - fuel consumption of the fleet (diesel and petrol) and buildings (diesel and natural gas). Caixa uses natural gas to heat its infrastructures (Porto and Leiria). In addition, it uses diesel fuel to run emergency groups.
![img-111.jpeg](img-111.jpeg)

There was a 15\% reduction in the consumption of diesel for generators; however, there was a 7\% increase in the consumption of natural gas in the infrastructures, culminating in a $5 \%$ increase in direct energy consumption in the infrastructures.

At fleet level, there was a 15\% increase in fuel consumption. In 2022, the constitution of Caixa's mobile fleet changed with an increase in the number of gasoline and LPG vehicles.

- Indirect energy - electricity consumption in central buildings and branch network.

In terms of electrical energy consumption, there was a $0.6 \%$ decrease, resulting from the various energy efficiency measures implemented, such as the installation of movement detectors in lighting.

In 2022, around 80 microproduction installations were converted to self-consumption, and electricity stopped being sold to the grid as of October. Since then, all the energy produced has been consumed at the facilities.

The solar power plant at Caixa's head office building consists of 158 solar collectors installed on $1600 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ of the building's roof at Av. João XXI (Lisbon), generating energy that is used to heat and cool (via an absorption chiller) water for air conditioning systems, sanitary facilities, and the cafeteria kitchen. This energy production and consumption allows for the reduction of electricity consumption from the grid.

Around 70 energy certifications/recertifications of Caixa properties were carried out in 2022, enabling the milestone of 500 certified premises to be reached.

In relation to energy consumption, the following results were achieved in 2022:
![img-112.jpeg](img-112.jpeg)

# France branch - Eco-efficiency in operations 

The France Branch promotes operational eco-efficiency, minimising, among other things, energy consumption, through various measures/initiatives such as:

1) Implementation of energy efficiency measures (installing LED lighting in all branches, installing presence switches, reducing heating to $19^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, among others);
2) Transition of the professional vehicle fleet to electric and hybrid vehicles (until now composed of diesel vehicles);
3) Extending the payment of the transport pass to employees who do not use motor vehicles to travel to work;
4) Change of head office in 2023 to a building that is eco-responsible in its design, construction and operation, investing in a virtuous building through the organisation of waste sorting, promotion of soft mobility, respecting the latest energy efficiency standards and certifications.

# Water consumption 

In terms of water consumption, with the return of the employees to the central buildings, there was a 6\% increase in consumption in relation to 2021.

In order to reduce the consumption and environmental impact of its activity, Caixa installed flow reducers on the washbasin taps of around 500 commercial network facilities, increasing their water efficiency to A or A+.

At the corporate level, in 2022, water consumption was as follows:
![img-113.jpeg](img-113.jpeg)

## Material consumption

Caixa's most significant consumption of materials is photocopy paper, envelopes, passbooks and plastic in the form of bank cards.

In terms of paper consumption, there was a slight increase of about $1 \%$ compared to 2021. In terms of plastic consumption in the form of bank cards, there was a 13\% decrease.

Caixa has implemented several measures in the dematerialisation of physical operations, namely:
![img-114.jpeg](img-114.jpeg)

- Reinforcement of digital contracting of Consumer Credit, with the launch of 100\% online contracting and assisted sales, with dematerialised contract signing;
- Promotion of the use of bank cards in non-face-to-face channels, strengthening customer service levels, with an automation process that speeds up the contracting of credit cards and contributes to the reduction of paper consumption, responding to customers' sustainability requirements;
- Implementation of a new assisted sales circuit for the Oferta Crédito Expresso (Express Credit Offer), where it is possible to make a commercial approach by telephone and allow the customer to review, accept the conditions and sign the contracts without going to the branch. All pre and contractual information is provided via Caixadirecta and signed digitally by the customer;
- Assisted card sales, enabling the remote subscribing of cards with a click, without the need to print documents and without the physical presence of the customer at the branches, avoiding the use of paper and other consumables and the costs inherent to travelling.

It should be noted that in 2023 Caixa will provide a completely dematerialised debit card contracting service on the on-site channel. Contracting using Signpad will allow the customer to consult the pre-contractual documentation, formalise and receive the complete documentation in digital support, reducing paper consumption to zero, as well as simplifying the process and improving the customer's experience.

In 2022, the main IT business support materials that were in service were the following: monitors $(10,669)$, thin clients $(5,143)$, laptops $(4,915)$, desktops $(3,044)$, citizen card readers $(2,523)$, tablets and sign pads $(2,157)$, optical readers $(1,329)$ and multifunction printers (900).

In terms of the Caixa Group's consumption of materials, there was a 8\% increase:

|  |  |  | MATERIALS |  |  |  |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| GLOBAL | CAIXA | BI | BCA | BCI | BNU MACAU | BCGA | TIMOR BRANCH |

# Caixa - Programme for Assets Donation 

![img-115.jpeg](img-115.jpeg)

Through its programme for donating goods to social institutions, Caixa promotes the reuse of materials, helping to reduce waste and waste generation. This programme allows responding to requests addressed to Caixa to donate furniture and IT equipment, and encourages the reuse of discontinued equipment and materials by local communities, schools and underprivileged citizens, which will give them new use and value.

In 2022, 7136 items of office furniture were donated, namely cupboards, chairs, desks, blocks of drawers.

## Caixa - Electronic Invoicing

Caixa ended 2022 with 1465 suppliers subscribing to electronic invoicing (1044 via auto-billing), which represents $85 \%$ of the documents issued in electronic format by its regular suppliers, real estate agents and appraisers, and demonstrates Caixa's efforts to massify this invoicing format.

## Banco Nacional Ultramarino (Macau) - Reduction of paper consumption

Digitalisation continues to expand at BNU and with this we have seen a reduction in the materials used. The area managing the central archive receives various types of printed documents for scanning and archiving. Considering environmental responsibility, there is a strong and constant communication with those responsible for documents in order to reduce paper consumption.

BNU continues to search for solutions for its Document Management System (DMS). A system that can include digital storage, workflows and document authentication/approval. The entire process will be simplified by eliminating the need for paper.

## Low-Carbon Programme

As part of its Environmental Policy, Caixa created the Low-Carbon Programme as a response to climate change. The Low-Carbon Programme embodies Caixa's strategy in this context, designed to help reduce the environmental impact of its activities, promoting sustainable development and simultaneously seeking to induce good practices in its stakeholders. The Low-Carbon programme is streamlined into four areas of action:

# 1) Low-Carbon Economy Financing 

![img-116.jpeg](img-116.jpeg)

Caixa aims to provide EUR 1.5 billion in sustainable financing by 2024 and has therefore strengthened its offer of financing solutions. An example of this offer is Caixa Casa Amiga do Ambiente Personal Loan, which allows you to meet, with differentiated conditions, the funding needs for construction works and/or the acquisition of equipment related to the specific purposes of Energy Efficiency, Environmental Management and Renewable Energy Sources.

## 2) Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions:

The monitoring and quantification of GHG emissions is essential for the implementation of measures to mitigate the effects associated with Caixa's value chain activity.

Caixa's GHG emissions are subdivided into three scopes:

- Scope 1: Direct emissions stemming from fuel consumption in buildings; direct emissions stemming from fuel consumption by the Caixa fleet; direct emissions stemming from F-gas leaks in equipment installed in Caixa's facilities.
- Scope 2: Indirect emissions stemming from electricity production.
- Scope 3: Work-related trips (aeroplane, train, boat; private transportation); treatment of waste produced in the facilities; investments.
![img-117.jpeg](img-117.jpeg)

There was a 1\% reduction in scope 1 emissions. Highlighting the significant reduction in leaks/repositioning of f-gases in equipment ( $90 \%$ reduction).

There was a slight decrease ( $0.5 \%$ ) in scope 2 emissions (location-based method) due to the reduction in absolute electricity consumption that occurred in 2022, despite the emission factor at national level having increased.

In scope 3 emissions, the calculation of emissions associated with business travel (category 6), waste treatment (category 5) and financing portfolio (category 15) was performed. As in the year 2021, it was found that scope 3 emissions - category 15 represent $99.7 \%$ of Caixa's emissions (location-based method).

The calculation of scope 3 emissions (category 15) was made in alignment with the guidelines of the standard "Partnership for Carbon Accounting Finantials" (PCAF) considering the value of on-balance exposure. We highlight below the sectors of activity in Caixa's sectorial portfolio ( $€ 15.1$ billion) with the most significant carbon emissions.

| Section | Activity | Emissions $\left(\mathrm{tCO}_{2}\right)$ | On-balance amount (€) |
| :--: | :-- | :--: | :--: |
| C | Manufacturing | $1,730,134$ | $3,826,218,680$ |
| D | Electricity, gas, steam, hot and <br> cold water and cold air | 331,161 | $741,560,326$ |
| E | Water collection, treatment and <br> distribution; sanitation, waste <br> management and remediation | 326,974 | $188,589,258$ |
| H | Transport and storage | 319,936 | $1,284,612,429$ |
| A | Agriculture, livestock, hunting, <br> forestry and fishing | 302,452 | $346,425,442$ |

With regard to mortgage lending ( 24.2 billion euros), the calculation methodology is based on the PCAF standard and the specific methodology of the "PCAF European building emission factor database". Total emissions were $352,729 \mathrm{tCO}_{2} \mathrm{e}$.

# Transition Plan 

Caixa has made a commitment to implementing strategies and business models that enable it to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 .

Caixa is therefore defining a Transition Plan which will reflect the bank's strategy and ambition to respond to the risks and opportunities arising from mitigation and adaptation to climate change and to limit the increase in global temperature to $1.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

This Plan is based on science-based (SBTi) funding scenarios analysis and sets out guidelines, actions and processes needed to minimise risks and maximise climate-related opportunities in the short term (2030) and in the long term (2050) for the most critical carbon-intensive sectors.

In a first stage, the Transition Plan will be published for the electricity generation, commercial real estate and cement sectors and for Caixa's own activities.

## 3) Mitigation of environmental operational risk

2 drills were carried out in the Head Office and Aliados building (Porto) in 2022. The drills took place at the Head Office Building on 5 December and at the Aliados Building on 9 December.

The Internal Emergency/Self-Protection Measures Plans in a fire scenario; the Organisation and Management of the Safety and Emergency Model; the activation of the Emergency Management Office; the intervention capacity of the Internal Means; the Evacuation Plans; the Action and Communication Protocols; the Environmental Management System; and the articulation with the Civil Protection Agents were successfully tested.

This drill, carried out under the terms of the Integrated Protection and Rescue Operations System (SIOPS), has a very large scale and complexity, allowing all those involved to improve procedures and their coordination, in order to act effectively in response to a response to a real incident.

To manage and mitigate environmental risk at Caixa's head office building, daily rounds are made to check the storage of critical and hazardous products, which are all duly identified, stored and placed in retention bins.

With a view to testing the procedures that have been set up, in 2022 Caixa carried out 13 operational exercises in which environmental disaster scenarios with hazardous materials, floods and small fires were tested.

In terms of self-protection measures, 56 evacuation drills were carried out by the commercial network, namely at properties with a $2^{\text {nd }}$ Risk Category.

# 4) Transparency and Awareness-Raising 

![img-118.jpeg](img-118.jpeg)

Caixa recognises that transparency, awareness and coordination with stakeholders (internal and external) is essential to achieve its commitment to being neutral in net carbon emissions by 2050.

Caixa has developed several awareness-raising contents on the Saldo Positivo portal. One of the issues on the agenda is the need to preserve biodiversity, forests and water, so several subjects were developed throughout last year, namely on biosphere reserves and the development of a sustainable economy, the selective collection of bio-waste, plastic consumption and overpackaging. Recognising their relevance, awareness-raising content was also developed on the subject of carbon markets, energy dependency and greenwashing.

# Caixa - ESG information disclosure to interested parties 

![img-122.jpeg](img-122.jpeg)

In 2022, Caixa published its first allocation and impact report on sustainable debt issuance. This document aims to inform investors, transparently, about the impacts on the environment and society of the funding carried out and to raise awareness among stakeholders to the importance of sustainable investment.

The Allocation and Impact Report was disclosed to 852 representatives from 495 entities, of which 471 are investors, 6 rating agencies and 18 bank analysts. This document has received significant interest from various media bodies, which demonstrates the relevance of the topic and Caixa's pioneering spirit.

## Caixa - Training on climate risks

During 2022, Caixa increased its training on climate risk issues for board members, heads of branches and affiliated banks, central directors and employees whose functions are directly or indirectly related to the Sustainability topic.

As part of the Permanent Education Program, a session on climate risks was held on 30 September, led by Professor Filipe Duarte Santos.

This session addressed issues related to climate change, namely impacts, adaptations, vulnerabilities and inherent risks. The feedback on the session was very positive with a satisfaction level of 4.6 out of 5 .

## Banco Comercial e de Investimentos - Reforestation Action

![img-123.jpeg](img-123.jpeg)

BCI was a partner in the initiative called 'Green Txuna Maputo' which aims to recover the arboreal green of Maputo City and minimise the effect of climate change, making the city more resilient, raising the natural thermal comfort, bringing a new integrated and sustainable landscape identity, taking into account that many of the impacts resulting from climate change significantly affect ecosystems, infrastructures, people and socio-economic values in several coastal and hinterland areas of Maputo Municipality.

## Banco Interatlântico - Challenges and opportunities for the banking system

Banco Interatlântico sponsored the institutional training workshop 'Corporate Governance: Challenges and opportunities for Cape Verde's banking system and economy', promoted by PSO Knowledge.

This training session was geared to banks and insurance companies in Cape Verde. This was an opportunity to debate and reflect on current topics in banking and insurance activities, namely corporate governance, ESG criteria, digital transition and fintechs.

# 4.10. Equity, digital and financial inclusion 

Inequality of opportunity is a complex global challenge that directly impacts various dimensions of society. In this context, companies must take an active role in the development of a culture underpinned by principles of diversity, equity and inclusion, which ensures not only the creation of value and the well-being of their employees, but also an effective response to the main challenges faced by society, such as digital exclusion or financial illiteracy.

## EQUITY, DEVELOPMENT AND WELL-BEING OF EMPLOYEES

For Caixa, the existence of a management system focused on the human factor and on a socially responsible leadership should involve all hierarchical levels of the company in creating an environment of respect, equity and inclusion, allowing the development and well-being of its employees. This approach may actively contribute to the mitigation of various risks, such as the risk of occupational diseases (e.g. burnout syndrome), accidents at work, wage inequalities or non-compliance with labor rights and practices.

Caixa's 2023 Equality Plan acknowledges that the balanced presence of women and men throughout the company's structure represents a significant evolution for its activity and an important contribution to fulfilling the commitments assumed by the Institution, namely respect for Human Rights and the pursuit of Sustainable Development Goals. As part of this, reference should be made to the Sustainability Committee, as the body overseeing compliance with Caixa's social commitments, including topics such as diversity and gender equality. It is also responsible for assessing draft policies, processes and other procedures to be implemented internally in order to comply with the Sustainability Strategy.

This chapter presents a set of projects and initiatives aimed at enhancing the positive impacts and minimising the negative impacts associated with this material topic. Caixa also measures and monitors various performance indicators in this chapter as well as in Annex A - Sustainability Indicators and/or in Annex B GRI index, thereby enabling the effectiveness of the measures implemented to be assessed.

## Training and development

The implementation of the 2022 training plan was a vital aspect in developing the teams, reflecting a clear focus on technical, business and regulatory training, as well as on the adoption of new methodologies, in a perspective of customisation to banking and practical exemplification.

The investment in training is an essential factor for the development of Caixa teams, translated into the following results achieved in 2022 (considering employees in permanent service at Caixa and employees on assignment):

- Number of training hours: 432,372 hours;
- Average number of training hours per employee: 74 hours (compared to the minimum number of forty hours of training established in article 131 of the Labor Code);

If the Domestic Perimeter is considered, total training hours amount to 490,000 hours (vs 485,000 in 2021) and the average number of training hours per employee increased to 75 hours (vs 71 hours in 2021). It is important to highlight the overall level of satisfaction with training initiatives, which reached $95 \%$, a $2 \%$ increase compared to 2021.

## Caixa - Customisation of training programmes

![img-124.jpeg](img-124.jpeg)

The customisation of training programmes was also reinforced in 2022, with an eye always on the future, as a key instrument for transforming the business, developing and motivating employees and managing critical knowledge for the organisation. Examples include the high potential employees programme (High Flyers Management Programme), the coordinators programme (Managing for the Future), the customer managers and commercial assistants programme (Upgrade and MIRA), bank managers development programme, the team-building events as reinforcement of the organisational culture and development of cross-cutting skills, together with specific programmes to reinforce leadership and technical skills.

![img-125.jpeg](img-125.jpeg)

In order to achieve the objectives associated with the 'Sustainability and Social Impact' area of the 2021-2024 Strategic Plan, Caixa considers the training and capacity-building of its employees on sustainability topics at the various levels of the organisation to be vital.

In 2022 Caixa launched a mandatory sustainability e-learning for all its employees. The main objective of this training module is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the 2021-2024 Sustainability Strategy's goals and simultaneously promote a greater alignment of organisational culture and practices.

At the end of 2022, the 'Sustainability - A Strategic Approach' e-learning reached a completion rate of 86\% and a satisfaction rate of $97 \%$. A set of e-learning courses that contribute to the fulfilment of the material areas of the 2021-2024 Sustainability Strategy also stand out, namely:

- Cybersecurity and Information Protection (completion rate of 99\%);
- Data Protection Culture at CGD (completion rate of 84\%);
- Ethics and Conduct (completion rate 98\%);
- Corruption Prevention and Related Offences (96\%);
- RGPD and new Data Protection Law - Rights of data subjects, Criminal and misdemeanour liability (98\%);
- Information Security - Identity and Access Management (96\%);

## Banco Caixa Geral Angola - Leading Change to Generate Results

In 2022, Banco Caixa Geral Angola continued to train its staff, notably employees in the commercial areas, on leadership-related topics, having launched in 2022 the branch and business centre leaders acceleration programme on the topic of 'leading change to generate results'.

This project, of significant transformation for Banco Caixa Geral Angola, requires the participation and involvement of various bank employees, from trainees to mentors, who, due to their experience, charisma, recognised competence and strong spirit of cooperation, may undertake different roles in promoting and supporting the intended change. This programme began in October 2022 and is scheduled to end in March 2023, with 44 employees participating.

Gender equality and non-discrimination
![img-126.jpeg](img-126.jpeg)

The principles of equality and non-discrimination are structural areas of society that Caixa has incorporated into its DNA from very early on. For the bank, these principles are also increasingly relevant for the creation of value in a business organisation, both as the fulfilment of a civilisational commitment and as an element of growth, efficiency, profitability and sustainability of the company.

In 2020 Caixa compiled all the initiatives in force in the Equality Plan, a document that sought to make even more consistent and visible the path that the bank had already begun to travel. The evolution of this plan's maturity index was significant, with an increase in 2022 of around $23 \%$ resulting from the initiatives implemented and resulting in strengths for Caixa's Equality Plan, namely:

- Top management commitment;
- Appreciation and interest of the topic at Caixa;
- Existence of global programmes and initiatives already ongoing;
- Structured Communication \& Image Plan with visibility abroad;
- Periodic monitoring of the plan through KPI set and communicated.

In order to build a future in which an inclusive environment prevails, with a real perception of investment in people and in the diversity and talent of its teams, Caixa presented its 2021-2024 Strategic Plan, a new cycle under the motto 'Building the Future'. Caixa's ambition for 2024, materialised in the new plan, is based on six transformation pillars, among which the 'People, Culture and Transformation' pillar, which proposes:

1) Promoting a culture of innovation, agility and transformation, while maintaining high standards of professionalism, integrity and transparency;
2) Boosting the corporate culture with an emphasis on talent development, training and internal cooperation, mobilising and committing the entire organisation to the transformation process
3) Rejuvenating and reinforcing staff competencies and rewarding talent with transparency and clarity of criteria;
4) Promoting the sustainability, equality and diversity of the teams.

To meet the challenges of this Strategic Plan, six major axes of action were outlined, which are worked on across the entire organisation under the concept 'At Caixa, Equality makes a Difference':

- Skills and talent management;
- Balancing personal and family life;
- Health and well-being;
- Women leadership;
- Communication and involvement;
- Knowledge management across different generations.

Caixa is committed to playing an active part in the transition towards a more sustainable future, influencing its stakeholders to adopt sustainability and responsible business principles.

The implementation of Ethical Principles and Best Business Practices was also ensured in the value chain, in order to instil sustainability practices in its suppliers, covering topics such as the promotion of labour practices that respect human rights.

In 2022, Caixa's major objective was to invest in a communication plan which, in a structured manner, enhanced the visibility of all of Caixa's actions in terms of equality and diversity, both internally and externally. The ongoing communication campaign covers all initiatives in force at Caixa and, from a perspective of awareness and involvement, reminds us that equal opportunities are a commitment for all and that at this bank it is a path that is already being travelled.

The initiatives being implemented are aimed at strengthening Caixa's journey towards equality, which already has $36 \%$ women in top management and $51 \%$ in management positions. Caixa's Chief Financial Officer position is held by a woman, Maria João Carioca, who is the only woman with this responsibility among Portuguese banks.

Equal opportunities lead to greater security and confidence among employees and, consequently, to higher levels of motivation and well-being.

As at 31 December 2022, Caixa's activity in Portugal (employees, own and assigned, allocated to Caixa's structural bodies) had 5837 employees, 2154 male (36.9\%) and 3683 female (63.1\%). Of those, 123 employees are physically disabled ( $2.1 \%$ ).

The age average is 45.7 years and around $75 \%$ of the employees have higher education qualifications, of which $66 \%$ are women.

# Banco Nacional Ultramarino (Macau) - Equal opportunities 

For Banco Nacional Ultramarino Macau, the principle of non-discrimination begins right from the start with the admission of employees, where all are equal, without distinction of any nature. The promotion of equality practices and the application of the principle of non-discrimination by gender is thus visible in various components, most notably the following:
i) At the level of professional categories, women represent $65 \%$ of management positions (management and senior management) and $59 \%$ of the intermediate management (technical staff + supervisors + officers);
ii) In terms of hours of training by gender, with an average number of hours of training received by women and men in 2022 of 18 hours and 21.2 hours respectively (with the professional categories with the highest average number of hours of training being middle and senior management).

## Recruitment, internal mobility and internship programmes

Considering the need to meet the strategic goals in the management of CGD Group's workforce, 65 External Recruitment Processes were launched in 2022, in order to strengthen specific skills in strategic areas, namely in the area of internal control and information systems. As part of these processes, CGD received around 464 applications.

In parallel, two internal recruitment processes were launched to reinforce certain areas throughout the Group, through the mobility of internal employees. A total of 15 employees applied.

## Caixa - Geração Caixa

![img-128.jpeg](img-128.jpeg)

In 2022, a new edition of the internship programme called 'Geração Caixa' (Caixa Generation) was launched, with the integration of 113 new trainees between January and December. The trainees worked in several areas of the group (commercial area, internal control, operations and support), enabling their skills development over 12 months, with the inclusion of a Caixa internship grant and significant investment in on-the-job learning.

## Talent management and valuing of human capital

Performance assessment is vital for advising, improving and providing guidance on the desirable evolution of individual performance, in order to ensure focus on the execution of what is a priority for customers and for Caixa, as well as for the strengthening of merit and the achievement of results by the teams.

As such, several initiatives were identified to improve the current Performance Management System and changes were implemented to the process for the 2022 evaluation (starting in January 2023).

In practical terms the following changes have been made:

- The requirement for two competencies for the management functions was reinforced, with the aim of increasing institutional cooperation and breaking down silos, as well as the development and mobility of people within the group;
- A $360^{\circ}$ feedback component by four contributors (peers and/or team) was included, with effective weight in the final evaluation;
- The final evaluation scale became numerical.

These changes will be consolidated and/or reinforced in the next evaluation process (regarding 2023) and already in the new integrated platform that will support CGD Group's HR processes.

# Caixa - Caixa Excelência Awards 

At the Caixa Fora da Caixa Meeting held on 19 March 2022, talent and merit were once again distinguished with the awarding of the Caixa Excelência 2022 Prize, which in this edition awarded 50 employees. This award aims to acknowledge the value and merit of employees and their performance, stimulating personal development and appreciation, with the aim of rewarding outstanding achievements that give the most relevant contributions to Caixa's results. Other communication initiatives to highlight Excellence were also carried out throughout the year.

The 2023 Excelência Prize was awarded in March 2023, this edition with a new feature, the award categories, as a way of encompassing the talent and merit shown in various areas and fields of action. Fifty employees were thus awarded, distributed across 7 award categories: Excellence in the Commercial Area (19); Excellence in the Corporate Business Network (2); Excellence in Team Management (11); Excellence in Recovery (2); Excellence in Process Optimisation (5); Excellence in Projects (6) and Excellence in CGD Culture (5).

## Caixa - Salary Review

Under the Company Agreement in force, Caixa concluded an agreement to revise the salary table and monetary expression clauses for 2023 with the Trade Union of Employees of CGD Group Companies (STEC) with the largest representation in the company, making Caixa Geral de Depósitos once again the first national credit institution to revise the salary table for 2023. With regard to the salary table, an increase of EUR 76 will be applied to all levels.

As regards monetary clauses, most of the items have a 5\% increase (including seniority payments, child benefits and study grants), with a significantly higher increase in the case of meal subsidy (a $9.36 \%$ increase), birth support subsidy (a $12.5 \%$ increase), student worker subsidy (a $7.58 \%$ increase) and maximum mortgage loan (an $8.70 \%$ increase), which represents the reinforcement of Caixa's commitment to birth rate, the qualification of its employees and access to housing in the best conditions, as well as support for employees in the current economic climate.

The conclusion of the review of salary tables and clauses now achieved is yet another distinctive element in the package of remuneration conditions for Caixa employees, in addition to the increase in variable remuneration to be achieved in the current year and following the transfer of the Pension Fund to Caixa Geral de Aposentacões (CGA) in which the advantageous retirement conditions for an important proportion of Caixa's employees were reaffirmed.

## Reconciliation between personal, family and professional life

Caixa fosters a balance between personal, family and professional life, supported by regulatory measures systematised by the DPE, and sustainable solutions agreed upon by the Social Action Unit. This is done by focusing on the prevention of various types of problems, by creating an inclusive environment, supporting integration, and also developing people.

It should be noted that measures that promote a balance between work and personal/family life are a contribution towards reducing tensions, with an impact on increasing motivation, on the level of productivity and also on retaining talent. The PAC - Employee Support Programme, carried out by the Social Action Unit, which consists of interventions in the socio-professional, socio-family, socio-economic, health and social responsibility areas, stands out among those measures.

Thus being, regarding the socio-family and socio-professional areas, the intervention guidelines include:

- Contributing to the creation of a social well-being environment;
- Contributing to a better conciliation between personal/family and professional life;
- Supporting employees in solving problems related to life events.

At the level of socio-family and socio-professional responsibility measures, the following examples stand out:
a) Family allowances: As a contribution to families' sustainability, there is a range of support to which the Social Action Unit directs employees according to their needs. Reference should be made to articulation with the DPE - Remunerações area (e.g. birth grants) and with CGD's Social Services (e.g. subsidy for disabled children and young people).
b) Intervention in crisis situations in the family system: The Social Action Unit analyses the situation and carries out family-oriented psychosocial counselling in crisis situations related to life events, such as: divorces, illnesses (including psychiatric and addictive illnesses), spousal unemployment, bereavement, as well as parenting and senior support. All interventions take place under strict confidentiality and are often referred to internal and community resources.
c) Telework: The new telework scheme that came into force on 01/01/2022, established telework as compulsory in certain situations. In this way, support is given as part of parenthood (situations of employees with children up to the age of 8 , inclusive), always bearing in mind the employee's function and involving the hierarchies. Also in situations of employees with the status of informal non-main caregiver, this instrument has shown great importance as a conciliation tool.

# Means of contact available to employees 

Caixa employees have several ways to file complaints or ask questions at their disposal.
They can submit the question through the application called 'helpdesk RH', available at CGD Group's human resources portal, 'Caixapessoal'. Through this application, the question will be sent directly to the respective HR area in order to obtain a personalised answer. This application generates a request number, and the employee is informed of the area and the person who is analysing the request and its status. Alternatively, employees may question/complain via email or letter, addressed to the DPE - Human Resources Division.

Whatever the form in which the complaint is received, it is forwarded to the area responsible for the matter in question, which will analyse it and draw up a proposed solution. This proposal is sent to the body with decision-making competence, in accordance with the competence outlined in the Manual for the Delegation of Competencies in Human Resources Matters. After the decision, it is disclosed to the employee.

For the specific situation of reporting harassment in the workplace, employees who have knowledge of the practice of harassment or who believe they are being subjected to harassment in the workplace must report it in writing to the Division in charge of the internal auditing, in one of the following ways:

- By sealed letter addressed to the Central Director of the DAI, with an indication of confidentiality;
- Through the DAI-Harassment Communication mailbox, with no obligation to communicate it to any other person or area of Caixa.

Any reported cases of harassment will be investigated for possible disciplinary action and dealt with in a confidential, impartial and efficient manner.

## Occupational health

In 2022, in compliance with the legal obligation, a total of 3789 medical exams were performed (Caixa and CGD Group companies)

- Initial/Admission Examinations: 155 (133 of occupational medicine Caixa + 22 SSCGD);
- Periodic Examinations: 3,318 (SSCGD);
- Occasional Examinations: 37;
- Occasional OS 27/2002 - Retirement on grounds of disease or disability agreed upon with the institution: 20;

The psychology department describes and monitors problem situations that impact the employee's health and well-being, affecting his/her performance and productivity, such as: working overtime, crisis situations (robbery, bereavement and other traumatic events), interpersonal conflicts, dissatisfaction, lack of motivation and burnout, and prolonged absenteeism due to illness (absence due to illness for more than 30 consecutive days).

In 2022, the psychology area described and monitored a total of 1,246 interviews:

- All situations of prolonged absenteeism due to illness, totalling 872 interviews;
- All problematic situations identified, totalling 374 interviews;


# Caixa - COVID-19 Pandemic management 

![img-129.jpeg](img-129.jpeg)

Given the context of the COVID-19 pandemic that began in February 2020 and continued in 2022, Occupational Medicine, in collaboration with the GPS and the DGR, implemented, as a means for clarification and closeness with its employees, the creation of a mailbox so that cases and/or suspicions of COVID19 could be reported at CGD, with the aim of implementing strategies for mutual assistance, problem solving, and monitoring of problematic situations triggered by the pandemic.

As part of this, 2,071 records/emails were analysed and processed and the clinical criteria of 103 employees with conditions for teleworking were analysed. On the other hand, the reports made through this mailbox gave us a better idea of the real impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Caixa in terms of absenteeism, whether due to illness, family assistance or others.

## INVESTMENT IN THE COMMUNITY

As a public bank, Caixa must respond to those who need it the most, according to the most pressing social emergencies

A strategic approach to corporate social responsibility should focus on developing strategies, policies and actions that foster a more responsible and inclusive business, promoting value creation for society and other stakeholders. Caixa's Community Involvement Policy recognises that involvement with the community (internal and external) should be one of the bank's social responsibility areas.

In terms of governance, the Sustainability Committee stands out as the body that assesses the implementation of projects aimed at creating a positive social impact on various dimensions of society, as well as their respective monitoring.

This chapter presents a set of projects and initiatives aimed at enhancing the positive impacts and minimising the negative impacts associated with this material topic.

Caixa also measures and monitors various performance indicators in this chapter and/or in Annex B - GRI index, thereby enabling the effectiveness of the measures implemented to be assessed.

![img-130.jpeg](img-130.jpeg)

The creation of the Caixa Social Awards enables Caixa to promote its economic and social project from a logic of sustained value creation for society, in line with its strategic challenges.

Given the current economic and social crisis, the 4th edition of the Caixa Social Awards required a broader reach and scope of action in order to respond to post-COVID challenges, support the recovery and strengthening of Social Economy entities that respond to the most vulnerable populations, contributing to their sustainable and inclusive growth through the following intervention axes:

- Recovery and Resilience;
- Digital Transformation and Empowerment;
- Green Economy and Ecological Transition.

With a global allocation of EUR 500,000, 593 applications were received and 29 projects were distinguished, with national representation and an expected impact on 10,326,000 direct beneficiaries.

The projects were assessed by a six-member independent panel, chaired by the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Caixa Geral de Depósitos, António Farinha Morais, and composed of Maria José Ritta, Maria del Carmen Gil, Eduardo Graça, Filipe Almeida, Filipe Santos and Viriato Soromenho Marques.

Representing an evolution in relation to past editions, the winning institutions participated in training sessions focused on the areas with the greatest need for development, aimed at supporting them in the implementation of their projects and ensuring the sustainability of the winning initiatives and subsequent measurement of the social impact.

The 2022 Caixa Social awards ceremony was held on 2 June, at Caixa's Head Office, and was attended by representatives of 27 distinguished social institutions.

# Banco Comercial do Atlântico - Partnership with Aldeias SOS 

![img-131.jpeg](img-131.jpeg)

As part of Banco Comercial do Atlântico's social responsibility policy, in May 2022 a three-year partnership protocol was signed between the bank and Aldeias Infantis SOS in Cape Verde. The protocol-signing event was attended by the Chairman of the Executive Committee and the representative of Aldeias SOS in Cape Verde.

## 'Sou Cidadão' (I'm a Citizen) Programme

Caixa continues its support to the needy or homeless, in order to facilitate the implementation of the National Strategy for the Integration of Homeless People (ENIPSSA 2017-2023), in coordination with the Group for Strategy Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation (GIMAE).

The "Sou Cidadão" (I'm a Citizen) programme financially supports the issuance and assignment of identification documents (citizen's card, passport, residence permit) to homeless people eligible for these documents, ensuring their integration.

The IPSS or beneficiary social entities ensure the process of identification of homeless people, the procedures with official entities, the delivery and follow-up with the beneficiaries and, subsequently, Caixa will pay the cost of issuing the identification documents.

This programme also aims to facilitate the identification and social integration of these people who are staying overnight in Caixa's automatic areas and branch network.

In 2022, Caixa ensured the issuance of 83 identification documents for homeless people, contributing towards retrieving their 'identity' and access to basic rights such as clinical and hospital assistance; benefits and/or subsidies; and others that ensure an integration process and contribute to reducing the number of socio-economic exclusion situations.

# Caixa - 2022 Christmas Campaign 

![img-132.jpeg](img-132.jpeg)

## Fostering knowledge

Caixa's support for the university segment has been increasing over the years and is based on the following pillars: support to the academic community, promotion of knowledge, promotion of access to higher education and economic, social and cultural responsibility. There are 46 higher education institutions (HEI) that, under the Caixa IU - Polytechnic Institutes and Universities programme, received from Caixa an investment of EUR 7.5 million in 2022.

# 1) Support to the Academic community: 

![img-141.jpeg](img-141.jpeg)

Caixa provides the university segment with access to a package of products and services, appropriate to their life cycle and to facilitate the management of their daily lives. Using digital customer onboarding processes and fast, effective contracting, the evolution of the sales and after-sales process was adapted to customers' expectations and continues to be Caixa's brand image in the university market. A simplification in sales, in line with the wishes of a generation for which time is a critical success factor.

## 2) Promotion of knowledge

More than 200 merit awards, research awards, scholarships and recognition of innovation projects bring higher education closer to home. In 2022 Caixa continued to reward the academic performance and merit of students, at the different schools that have Caixa's support or the professional performance of employees of educational institutions.
![img-142.jpeg](img-142.jpeg)

## 3) Promotion of access to Higher Education

![img-143.jpeg](img-143.jpeg)

Caixa organised the Caixa Mais Mundo Awards for the fourth consecutive year with the aim of recognising the academic merit of students who have completed secondary education and who applied through the national application for admission in the 2021/2022 academic year, at national level, to HEIs which have a protocol with Caixa.

In a year in which social inequalities have grown, Caixa has increased its support by doubling the number of prizes and social scholarships (total of 300 prizes, each worth EUR 1000) for students enrolled in HEIs with a protocol with Caixa, thereby creating an opportunity for more students, including more financially vulnerable social groups, to continue their studies in higher education and offset the added costs of school attendance.

The prizes were awarded taking into account the following distribution:

- 110 Academic Merit Awards: national students enrolled in degree courses or in Vocational Higher Technical Courses (CteSP);
- 100 Scholarships for students in need: national students enrolled in degree courses and in Vocational Higher Technical Courses (CteSP), who can prove economic difficulties to ensure their regular attendance at higher education (according to the award criteria of the DGES);
- 50 Merit Awards for students in vocational courses: students who have completed secondary vocational courses and continued their studies in Higher-Education Institutions;
- 40 Merit Awards for PALOP students: students who have concluded secondary education in Portugal and who enrol in degree courses at Portuguese HEIs.

In view of the success and openness to these awards in the academic community, Caixa has approved a new cycle of editions of the Caixa Mais Mundo Awards with an increase in the budget allocation and number of prizes.

# 4) Economic, social and cultural responsibility 

Caixa promotes support in different areas such as entrepreneurship, employability, the economy, innovation and technology. Caixa is thus strengthening its presence and support for the academic population and HEIs. All the developments which Caixa has incorporated in its relationship with higher education prove its contribution to its development in Portugal, always with the concern of contributing to projects capable of elevating knowledge and, in parallel, improving the quality of customer service, products and services.

# Promoting culture 

![img-147.jpeg](img-147.jpeg)

The activity programme of the Caixa Geral de Depósitos Culturgest Foundation is part of the mission, outlined in its articles of association, of developing cultural, artistic and scientific initiatives. For over a quarter of a century, Culturgest has pursued this mission by presenting a programme dedicated to contemporary creation in the fields of performing arts, music, visual arts and cinema, supplemented by a panel of conferences and debates that seek to bring a critical and open look at the world around us and with a diversified offer of participatory initiatives and programmes for schools.

Supplementing its artistic goals, Culturgest's main goal is to increase and diversify its audiences. In an increasingly developed and educated society, Culturgest's bold programming has the ability to dialogue with a broad and growing audience. After two years marked by the Covid-19 pandemic, with compulsory closures and restrictions on capacity, the number of visitors and spectators to Culturgest's cultural programme has recovered remarkably.

With 88,130 visitors and spectators, Culturgest achieved the best result of the last 25 years.
In 2020, Culturgest created a new online offer, which, driven by the closure of cultural equipment and the lockdowns of the Covid-19 pandemic, reached 56,600 visitors in the very first year. In 2021, the number of accesses to Culturgest's digital content grew to 70,950. Already in a normal context, the number increased again in 2022 to 77,250 visitors. Culturgest maintained its policy of affordable prices, developed on a permanent basis, providing tickets for shows, exhibitions and other cultural events at affordable prices for all, with additional specific discounts for young people, seniors, people with disabilities and those accompanying them, the unemployed, among others.

As coordinator of the European ACT - Art, Climate, Transition project, which brings together ten organisations from ten European countries, in 2022 Culturgest paid attention to the topics of ecological sustainability and climate action, through various initiatives. The MUDAR cycle of conferences focused on the risk and impact of climate change and the importance of diversity and inclusion as strategic topics for sustainable development.

## Banco Nacional Ultramarino (Macau) - Promotion of local culture

![img-149.jpeg](img-149.jpeg)

BNU has played a prominent role in supporting local culture, sponsoring and promoting it in areas as diverse as music, film, literature, photography, performing arts and other forms of expression of Chinese and Portuguese traditions. As part of this, the following are noteworthy:

- Sponsorship of the book 'Inquirições Sínicas' by Paulo Maia e Carmo;

# Caixa - Caixa Cultura 2022 Programme 

![img-150.jpeg](img-150.jpeg)

Throughout its history, Caixa has maintained close ties with the community and has constantly intensified its support to cultural activities.

The Caixa Cultura Programme was created to support artistic and cultural initiatives with the aim of financially promoting national projects of unequivocal quality and creativity in the following categories: theatre, dance, music, visual arts, cinema, literature, performance, conferences and debates.

In 2022 two editions were held which awarded a total of nine projects.

## Caixa - Caixa para Jovens Artistas Competition

Caixa's competition for young artists is a Caixa and Fundação Caixa Geral de Depósitos - Culturgest initiative for artists aged between 25 and 35. Adriana Progranó, Dayana Lucas, Fernão Cruz, Igor Jesus, João Gabriel and Sara Mealha are the six winners of the first edition.

Caixa acquired the works of these six artists, which became part of Caixa's contemporary art collection, for a total amount of EUR 48,000. This initiative inaugurates a new chapter in the history of the Caixa collection, opening doors to younger generations with the aim of promoting their qualification and consolidation in the domestic art market.

## Banco Caixa Geral Angola - Caixa Artes

The Caixa Artes initiative was created with the main objective of promoting and disseminating the Portuguese language, Angolan art and culture.

Responsible for Caixa Angola's social performance in the arts, Caixa Artes supports a multidisciplinary spectrum of sustainable artistic manifestations, which celebrate excellence and promote the rescue and stimulation of dialogue and sharing of Angola's history, driving innovation and artistic appreciation.

The following exhibitions stand out among the most varied projects to encourage Art and Culture:

- 'CONSTRUIR O TEMPO' - Solo exhibition by Mónica Miranda, curated by Suzana Sousa, from 9 September to 19 October 2022, Instituto Camões Luanda;
- 'CARVOEIROS' - Exhibition by Paulo Amaral, from 4 to 26 November 2022, Instituto Camões Luanda.

# Historical Heritage 

The rationalisation of spaces in Caixa's Head Office Building continued to be a priority throughout 2022, maintaining the need for careful selection of the Historical Heritage (HH).

In this context, an inventory project of the entire museum collection was developed and the updating of the decorative collection was continued, whose management is the responsibility, by internal regulation, of the Communication and Brand Department.

The year 2022 was also decisive in establishing the relationship between Caixa and the Design and Fashion Museum (MUDE), through the donation of pieces which were part of the assets of BNU's head office building, where MUDE is now installed. The formalisation of the commitment will be ensured during the year 2023.

Caixa donated to the City Council of Porto the sculptural friezes, bas-reliefs that were originally produced for the Caixa branch in Av. dos Aliados, in order to give it back its integrity and greater visibility.

Projects promoting the dissemination of Caixa's HH internationally were also developed, namely:

- The tapestry 'The Arrival of Vasco da Gama to Calicut', which is currently in storage in the custody of the National Museum of Ancient Art, was shown at an exhibition at the Chateau d'Angers, in France, between June and October 2022;
- The works 'Tiger' and 'Unknown', by artist Júlio Pomar, are on display at the Washington Dulles Airport in New York, in an exhibition promoted by the Arte Institute, which will be open until March 2023.

Giving Caixa employees the opportunity to acquire pieces that were part of the institution's heritage, three internal sales of decorative arts and furniture were organised, bringing together surplus pieces without historical relevance and silkscreens by secondary authors.

Bearing in mind the importance of the institution's historical heritage and its contribution to the construction of the country's collective memory, Caixa collaborated, throughout the year, in various initiatives, namely exhibitions, conferences and other specific initiatives.

The support service to researchers through the availability of documentation from the Historical Archive was maintained, with about 50 internal and external requests having been made.

At the end of the year Caixa participated, as part of the Historical Archives, in the Focus Group on the proposed strategy for safeguarding and enhancing the value of SOC (State-Owned Companies) Archives, created by DGLAB - Direção Geral do Livro, Arquivos e Bibliotecas (Directorate General of Books, Archives and Libraries). This project aims to assess needs, identify problems, present improvements and outline strategies for better management of these archives.

## Banco Comercial do Atlântico - Donation of Mediatheque archives

In 2022, Banco Comercial do Atlântico, together with Garantia and the Promoter, signed a protocol for the donation of the collections of the Mediatecas of Praia and Mindelo archives, which will be managed by the Public University of Cape Verde (UNICV).

The chairman of the executive committee of Banco Comercial do Atlântico, Francisco Santos Silva, pointed out that the management of the Mediateca collections, which was previously the responsibility of the three institutions mentioned, would now be carried out by an entity with a greater vocation for this purpose, and which will certainly enhance it through greater proximity to its main users, teachers and students, thus enriching UNICV's infrastructures.

This initiative will contribute to free access to culture and information in Cape Verde.

# ACCESSIBILITY AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION 

Financial accessibility and inclusion contributes to economic and social development, encouraging the sustainable development of the economy and stimulating the gradual improvement of the population's living conditions.

Caixa's Community Involvement Policy outlines the objective of promoting best practices in meeting the challenges of Portuguese society, with social and financial inclusion being one of its three strategic axes.

Over the years, Caixa has developed several projects and initiatives aimed at promoting inclusion and digital and financial literacy among its customers, and Caixa's approach in this area is regularly followed and monitored by the Sustainability Committee.

This chapter presents a set of projects and initiatives aimed at enhancing the positive impacts and minimising the negative impacts associated with this material topic. Caixa also measures and monitors various performance indicators in this chapter and/or in Annex B - GRI index, thereby enabling the effectiveness of the measures implemented to be assessed.

## Digital Banking

![img-151.jpeg](img-151.jpeg)

Caixa consolidated its leadership as the digital bank of the portuguese in 2022, with expressive growth in the number of active digital customers and remote business. In the domestic market, Caixa reached 2.2 million active digital customers, comprising households and companies, representing $65 \%$ of the customer base and $8 \%$ year-on-year growth.

Also noteworthy is the growth of the mobile channel, which reaches 1.5 million household and business customers ( $18 \%$ year-on-year) and whose relevance has been increasing among users.

The increase in the number of digital customers contributed to increasing to $80 \%$ the weight of online sales ( +5 pp YoY), also increasing the satisfaction levels (80/100) and recommendation of the digital channels: $58 \%$ of customers recommend Caixa's channels (Brandscore study 4Q 2022).
![img-152.jpeg](img-152.jpeg)

Throughout the year, Caixa placed innovation at the service of its customers, which proved to be essential in ensuring greater satisfaction with the service, generating more access and more business. In December, Caixadirecta was accessed on more than 275 million occasions, with the app representing $85 \%$ of logins. Also the number of operations, which totalled 84 million, registered a significant growth of $12 \%$ in comparison with the same period of the previous year.

Marked by a strong innovation component and focused on customers' needs, the Caixadirecta app remains the country's banking app with the highest number of users and highest number of app shop ratings.

The Contact centre, which since 2021 has had a Virtual Assistant guaranteeing greater efficiency in service, recorded high average satisfaction levels, of $77 \%$ (Customer Satisfaction Score).

# Eu Sou Digital programme 

EUSOUDIGITAL is a simple and free digital initiation programme. Developed with adults over 45 years of age in mind, with little or no contact with the internet, this programme brings together students and mentors/volunteers in a one-to-one learning dynamic. The Adult Digital Inclusion Programme (\#EUSOUDIGITAL) is registered under the Social Impact Bond (SIB) mechanisms within the Social Inclusion and Employment Operational Programme (POISE).

This programme is in line with Caixa's strategy and contributes to socio-economic, cultural and digital knowledge and inclusion, and makes it possible to act under the values of active citizenship and respect for human rights. Currently, this SIB mechanism is available in the programmes in the North, Centre, Alentejo, Lisbon and Algarve regions, aiming at the digital inclusion of 200,000 citizens by 2023.

The Adult Digital Inclusion Programme (\#EUSOUDIGITAL) application to the SIB-POISE has three mandatory stakeholders: the social investor (Caixa) - funder of the programme; the implementing entity (A2D/MUDA) - responsible for the operational execution of the programme, and the public administration entity responsible for the application's objective - digital inclusion (the Foundation for Science and Technology).

The execution model is strengthened with the shared management between all partners in the control of all incentive mechanisms, namely financial control and support in reporting to the programme management entity and the participation of an entity that evaluates the achievement of the results/objectives.

The strategy and actions include the activation of teams of volunteers and the development of training initiatives in 'MUDA Centres' supported by educational and social partners (secondary schools, universities, polytechnics, charitable institutions, senior universities, municipalities and other social entities that support the community) and business partners (private organisations that want to train in basic digital skills their employees and/or their customers who make available the places for training as well as internal volunteers). After the training process, certificates are issued to ensure that citizens have the minimum digital skills (managing email, carrying out online searches, accessing social media and using digital services - e.g. access to homebanking.

For the development of this programme, Caixa, as a social investor, provides the investment amounts considered eligible for support under the SIB - POISE and have as counterpart the achievement of quarterly objectives in number of digitally trained adults; the expenses incurred will be fully reimbursed by POISE, through payments made directly to the Social Investor, Caixa.

# Caderneta App 

![img-155.jpeg](img-155.jpeg)

With 143 years of existence, the Caderneta (Passbook) is a Caixa heritage recognised by all generations.
In April 2018, the Caderneta evolved, adapting to modern times while retaining the features that made the Portuguese fond of it. This new solution was created with the input of the target audience and took on an App format, thus becoming a digital inclusion solution with the mission of introducing and facilitating the adoption of digital means for financial services, seeking to promote the digitalisation of the older population and improve their banking experience. This digital and environmentally responsible solution reduces the impact on Portuguese forests by about 12.8 tonnes of paper per year.

Main distinguishing factors:

- Very simple and adapted to customers' needs (simplified menus, with icons in enlarged format);
- Allows making notes on account movements, consumption analysis and direct contact with the assistant;
- Sustainable solution: saves paper and contributes to the digital inclusion of the population.


## Caixa digital assistant

CAIXA is the Smart Digital Assistant of the Caixadirecta app, which allows Caixa customers to manage their personal finances by voice, 24/7. Supported by artificial intelligence, it is able to understand and hold conversations, answer questions, provide information and perform customer requests.

Activated in natural language (in Portuguese, from Portugal, and English), this solution allows for an experience close to human interaction and, besides being the first transactional voicebot in the Portuguese banking sector, it is the only one integrated in a banking app.

CAIXA answers customers' queries, provides information and is the only assistant in the market that makes payments, transfers, consults account balances and operations, registers card requests and reactivates Caixadirecta, if customers do not remember the service access code, making it an even more complete tool for those seeking simplicity in accessing the bank.

The CAIXA Digital Assistant is aimed at customers seeking a customised and innovative experience, who value security, mobility, speed and efficiency in a banking service. This solution simplifies the relationship with the Bank, enhancing proximity and improving the experience in a digital context, while promoting the digital inclusion of the visually impaired population or those with greater difficulty in using technology.

This service has been developed for Caixa's individual customers, who are very demanding and see voice contact as a fast and effective alternative to the usual ways of carrying out banking transactions, in often adverse contexts.

This solution, which is a benchmark in the national banking sector, recorded an annual accumulation of 3.6 million (January-December 2022) in December. Year-on-year, the number of enquiries via the assistant grew by $34 \%$ and the number of transactions by $93 \%$, which shows not only the usefulness of the voice service but also the trust of users, who can now count on the Assistant to request credit cards.
![img-156.jpeg](img-156.jpeg)

The Digital Assistant of the Caixdirecta app won the Banking Tech Awards 2022 in the Best Use of AI - Intelligent Assistant category. The Banking Tech Awards have been recognising excellence and innovation in financial services around the world for 23 years. The Digital Assistant was also the winner of the 5-Star Award, in the 'Virtual Assistant' Category.

# Caixa - Voicebot Caixa Contact Center 

In recent years, Caixa has seen a growing increase in calls to the contact center, it being essential to give customers the autonomy to contract products and services and get answers to their questions under a self-service scheme.

Therefore, in 2020, Caixa adopted a voice solution that enables it to understand customers' intentions, giving an immediate response without making it impossible to switch to an assistant with greater skills for the user's request, whenever this is required or business rules so establish. The voicebot of the Caixa Contact Center is a customer service solution based on artificial intelligence to automate banking operations, which focuses on improving the customer journey by using natural language recognition technologies (spoken or written) to infer the user's needs and thus provide the necessary answers.

The Voicebot of the Contact Center is also an inclusive solution because it allows interactions with all customers in natural language (with recognition of different pronunciations) and ensures that their requests are answered automatically, with a humanised voice and in a conversational context, which makes it convenient and accessible in any interaction.

Two years after its implementation, the results have exceeded expectations, with more than 4 million calls answered and 10 million conversations from 2.2 million customers. Also of note is a semantic accuracy of $9.2 \%$, which makes this solution very reliable among users.

On the other hand, it also made it possible to increase productivity, optimise resources and reduce the travelling of assistants and customers, which significantly reduces the carbon footprint if we consider that this smart assistant has the ability to serve 2.8 million customers.

![img-157.jpeg](img-157.jpeg)

Saldo Positivo is Caixa's financial literacy portal, a pioneer in this speciality, which aims to make a positive contribution to increasing the financial literacy levels of Portuguese people. The portal meets the needs of multiple audiences, from families, youngsters, seniors and entrepreneurs. Its content covers current issues such as environmental awareness, the importance of digital technology, family budget management, laws and taxation, training, mobility, among other topics that have an impact on the population's day-to-day life.

Saldo Positivo fits into the 'Equity, Digital and Financial Inclusion' pillar of the 2021-2024 Sustainability Strategy and aims to contribute to building a future that promotes the financial and digital empowerment of customers.

Throughout 2022, Caixa redesigned the Saldo Positivo programme to ensure greater coverage of content with an impact on the youth segment, currently having a specific section entitled 'Os contos do Sebastião' (Tales by Sebastian) which, in a simple, fun-filled and adapted language, contributes to raising the awareness of this target to sustainability and financial literacy best practices.

Additionally, Saldo Positivo maintains its approach to the ESG topic in an eclectic manner, as a result of a network approach between the various cross-cutting topics that it encompasses.

# Key indicators: 

- Average monthly publication of 23 articles;
- Average monthly no. of visitors 452,920, which corresponds to a $28.5 \%$ growth compared to 2021;
- Facebook profile with 137,000 followers.


## Caixa - Digital Literacy Programme

![img-158.jpeg](img-158.jpeg)

The Financial Literacy Working Group, of which Caixa is a member, is responsible for the development of initiatives geared to different target audiences, namely students, the general public and the senior population. APB, in collaboration with the associated banks, participates every year in a series of activities with different partners, most notably the Financial Training Week (PNFF) and the World Investor Week (CMVM/IOSCO). In this context, the Digital Literacy Programme on the topic 'All you need to know about online banking', which aims to contribute to the training of the senior population in the use of digital channels, stands out.

Free information sessions were organised and open to the general public, in 2022, essentially aimed at the older population who are not yet familiar with using online banking, either via computer or mobile phone. This programme consisted of 12 information sessions that ran until July 2022, on a monthly basis and promoted by representatives of APB member banks.

# Banco Comercial e de Investimentos - Financial Literacy 

![img-159.jpeg](img-159.jpeg)

Banco Comercial e de Investimentos developed several financial literacy initiatives in 2022, namely:

Global Money Week: As part of this initiative, Banco Comercial e de Investimentos held financial education talks, with question and answer sessions, at the Polana Secondary School, located in the city of Maputo, attended by around 40 Grade 12 students.

World Savings Day: Banco Comercial e de Investimentos, in collaboration with the German-Mozambican Cultural Centre, held a talk and debate on savings, financial planning and financial independence. The Savings Day events focus on young people of school age so that they can get familiar with these concepts and practices.

## France Branch - Un Banquier dans ma Classe

![img-160.jpeg](img-160.jpeg)

In 2022 the France Branch continued its participation in the initiative 'Un Banquier dans ma Classe'. This initiative, promoted by the French Banking Federation, is based on a simulator game that aims to make participating pupils aware of the notions of budget, means of payment, saving and security.
14,325 students participated in seven editions of this initiative.

## CYBERSECURITY AND DATA PROTECTION

With the increase in cybercrime and similar threats, boosted by new technologies, the engagement and commitment of all employees, whatever their role, is crucial for the security and protection of the information and Communication technologies (ICTs) managed by them while performing their activities.

Proper preservation of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information is a legal, regulatory and ethical imperative for Caixa and all its structures and employees, and a pillar of trust and sustainability in Caixa's relationship with customers and other stakeholders.

Caixa's Global Information Security Policy formalises the strategic and programme outlines approved by Caixa's Board of Directors for information security matters, as well as its commitment to meeting applicable requirements related to information security. In addition, the Privacy and Personal Data Protection Policy also aims to foster a corporate culture of compliance on data protection within the CGD Group, while contributing towards achieving cross-cutting enhancement of the commitment from members of the governing bodies and all employees to personal data protection.

In terms of governance, particular reference should be made to the Delegated Data Governance and Information Security Delegated Board (CDGS), a deliberative body of the Executive Committee that oversees activities carried out in the field of Data Governance and Quality and assesses and coordinates information security initiatives in Caixa and the CGD Group. The CDGS meets on a monthly basis and is composed of the directors responsible for the DSI and the DGR, by the elements with cross-cutting data management functions, Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Data Officer, by the top managers of the main divisions that supply or use data and by elements with cross-cutting management, organisation and control functions.

It is also important to highlight the Business Continuity, Operational Risk and Internal Control Delegated Board (CDCRC) as the deliberative body of the Executive Committee responsible for coordinating, assessing and discussing matters related to the management of operational risk and internal control deficiencies at Group level, as well as matters pertaining to the monitoring and management of data protection and the

monitoring of reputational risk. This Delegated Board meets ordinarily on a monthly basis, but extraordinary meetings may be called as instructed by the Chief Risk Officer, who chairs this board, or, in cases of personal data breaches, by the data protection emergency team.

This chapter presents a set of projects and initiatives aimed at enhancing the positive impacts and minimising the negative impacts associated with this material topic. Caixa also measures and monitors various performance indicators in this chapter and/or in Annex B - GRI index, thereby enabling the effectiveness of the measures implemented to be assessed.

# IT Strategic Plan 

Caixa's IT Strategic Plan is based on the transformation of six basic pillars of the information systems with a view to: increasing the capacity and delivery of priority functionalities, reducing operational risk and optimising costs.

1) Application: Modernise the application platform serving Caixa's customers and business processes to ensure greater efficiency and speed in meeting the needs of customers and the Bank.
2) Infrastructure: Renew and enhance the infrastructure, boosting the use of the cloud, thus creating greater resilience and recovery capacity.
3) Cybersecurity: Protecting critical systems and sensitive information against cyber-attacks.
4) Data: Ensuring the necessary information for reporting and decision-making.
5) Delivery and Operation: Increase the capacity to deliver solutions to the business, as well as optimise IT operations, through the review/adoption of new methodologies, processes and tools.
6) Resources: Create/increase internal IT skills in order to enhance, retain and valorise resources.

Strategic IT Pillars and Data \& Analytics 2022-2024 - \% implementation progress
![img-161.jpeg](img-161.jpeg)

As part of the implementation of the IT Strategic Plan, it is important to highlight the following programmes:

- OMNICANAL Programme and MIRA Programme: Implement the omnichannel concept, covering from self-service to the Branch platform, with integrated support from customer management (CRM) and targeted marketing (MARTEC) platforms, enabling simpler and more digital processes and an integrated customer experience;
- CRÉDITO à HABITAÇÃO Programme: Implement a collaborative digital experience on a single home credit platform for all stakeholders, with integrated functionalities for real-time monitoring and management of processes (simulation, eligibility, pricing, decision, client acceptance, evaluation,

contracting) and functionalities for offer management, partners and service providers network management;

- ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING (ERP): Programme: This programme, which is still taking its first steps in analysing gaps between Caixa's processes and standard tools, aims to provide the bank with the ability to execute financial, logistical and resource management processes in an expeditious, simplified and unconstrained manner, discontinuing a set of obsolete applications and modules;
- GOLDEN SOURCE Programme: Initiatives to build an operating model for handling the bank's data and simultaneously build a data concentrator seen as golden source for the entire CGD group and regulatory bodies. This central data repository already contains around $75 \%$ of Caixa's data representation and aims to serve a large majority of new data requests in 2023;
- RECUPERAR Programme: Guaranteeing the resilience of services, in order to allow business continuity, at least for the most critical services, in case of failure/disaster in the IT infrastructure is the objective of this programme. In 2023 it will be a goal to execute a transition plan, investing in infrastructure that allows for an increase in the degree of coverage and efficiency of the information recovery process of distributed systems indicated as critical and, whenever possible, leveraging on a Cloud infrastructure;
- MONITORIZAR 'Measuring and knowing the problems is the way to improve' Programme: The aim of this programme is to establish a proactive and thorough monitoring of the main critical services for Caixa's customers and business across technological layers. In 2022 it was possible to set up the tool and place under monitoring about 15 critical services, with alarm generation already available for operation performance.


# Caixa - Virtualisation of servers and workstation 

Virtualisation is nowadays the technology with the greatest impact on companies' information technology infrastructure. This allows a large number of virtual servers to be created from a reduced set of physical machines that are shared. This way, it is possible to reduce space consumption and, consequently, energy consumption.

Virtualisation also makes it possible to reduce the environmental impact of server decommissioning. Caixa currently has around 3,100 virtualised servers supported on 140 physical hosts.

## Caixa - Main internal DSI initiatives

![img-162.jpeg](img-162.jpeg)

The Information Systems Division (DSI) has designed a comprehensive communication plan for internal employees, CGD Group employees in general and even partners and suppliers. This communication has been translated into various events, publications or other types of initiatives.

It is important to highlight DSI's annual event, which took place in March and was attended by all the internal employees who perform their duties there, as well as by other IT areas of the CGD Group (Timor, Angola, Mozambique, Macao, Cape Verde, France). The SummerBIT was held in July, an event where the status of the main pillars of the Strategic Plan is reviewed, focusing especially on the projects with the greatest impact.

# Caixa - IT equipment donation 

![img-163.jpeg](img-163.jpeg)

Caixa has been donating IT equipment, namely desktop computers and laptops to various education institutions and establishments. This donation programme has supported primary, secondary and university students from various parts of the country who would otherwise not have the financial means to acquire these digital resources and tools.

In 2022, Caixa donated 300 pieces of IT equipment.

## Data protection

As part of the European Digital Agenda, which aims to enshrine the Digital Single Market in the European Union, personal data protection shall be assumed, by companies and organisations, as a new reality and as a critical factor for the success of ongoing digital transformation processes. Compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an opportunity to provide customers with a quality service and add value to the relationship of trust that they have with Caixa and the Caixa Group. This is achieved by strictly self-assessing its internal processes and procedures for handling customer and employee data.

In terms of Caixa's control and compliance with data protection legislation, we highlight the following initiatives:

- Update of the Personal Data Protection Policy: In December 2022, the OS COR 11/2018 Personal Data Protection Policy was updated, with a view to ensuring compliance with Law no. 58/2019 which ensures the implementation, in the national legal system, of the RGPD. This update also aims to accommodate the regulatory evolution that has occurred and the guidelines and opinions of the national supervisory authority on personal data protection, with the updated version being transposed to the group's entities. CGD Group entities are completing the process of transposing this corporate standard into their respective internal regulations, thereby contributing to the maturity of the CGD Group's organisational culture of compliance with data protection and strengthening the trust of its customers and stakeholders;
- Update of the Data Protection Governance Model: Corporate OS 4/2019, concerning the Data Protection Governance Model for the CGD Group, aims to operationalise the Personal Data Protection Policy and the Privacy and Personal Data Protection Policy by outlining the internal governance model and assigning responsibilities and high-level guidelines on that matter to the identified stakeholders, enshrining institutional monitoring and reporting methods on data protection, as well as the regular and urgent decision-making bodies on this matter. CGD Group entities are completing the process of transposing this corporate standard into their internal regulations.
- Process of implementing a technological tool to support data protection management: In 2022, work continued on the process of implementing a technological tool to support data protection management, with a corporate scope. This tool is composed of the several modules, in particular: Data mapping; automation of data protection assessments; response to exercise of data subject rights; consents; cookies compliance; vendor management; data breach incident management. Considering the technical complexity, the volume of corporate information to be processed under this project and the different legislation applicable in the geographic locations where Caixa operates, the full implementation in Caixa will be completed by the end of May 2023. At Caixa, some modules are already in production, namely the one concerning cookies compliance (since March 2022). In some of the entities, such as the France and Timor Branches, the modules are already being produced.

# Caixa - International Data Protection Day 

![img-164.jpeg](img-164.jpeg)

To celebrate International Data Protection Day, which is celebrated on 28 January each year, the intranet (SomosCaixa) disseminated a piece of news referring to the occasion and reiterating the importance of compliance with data processing principles and the responsibility of each and every employee for compliance in this matter. The competitive added value that compliance with its data protection activity represents for Caixa was also emphasised, as being a catalyst for the banking business and intervention in the country's economy, and the corporate aspect of the data protection strategy was highlighted.

## Banco Caixa Geral Angola - Training on data protection issues

Banco Caixa Geral Angola provided specific training on data protection, delivered in an e-learning format, covering the main concepts in this area, such as: the importance of personal data; knowing the personal data categories; what to do in case of a failure or breach related to personal data; among other relevant concepts. The training covers all of the Bank's employees, 330 of which were trained by 31 December 2022.

This training is still ongoing.

# 4.11. Transparent governance models 

Caixa believes that ethical and transparent management practices are key to boosting performance in a responsible and diversified manner. In this context, Caixa has been building a more efficient governance model, based on an organisational culture committed to meeting the expectations and needs of customers, employees, shareholders, regulators and other stakeholders, taking up the basic values that should guide the activity of an institution that is a reference in the Portuguese economy and society.

## ESG GOVERNANCE PRACTICES AND ETHICAL CONDUCT IN BUSINESS

Ethical and transparent management practices are key to maintaining the confidence and credibility of the financial sector. Companies that have solid and agile governance models and that incorporate ESG dimensions become particularly resilient to risks and increase their ability to create value over time.

Caixa maintains in force a number of standards and other internal documents that contribute to this goal, including, among others, the Code of Conduct, the Internal Governance Policy, the Diversity Policy for Caixa Group Employees and Members of Caixa's Management and Supervisory Bodies; Caixa's Global Policy on Preventing and Managing Conflicts of Interest; its Policy and Plan for Preventing Corruption and Related Offences, and the service order for Delegated Boards, Committees and Advisory Boards detailing information on the scope and powers associated with the Sustainability Committee, the body responsible for disseminating ESG practices throughout the organisation.

This chapter presents a set of projects and initiatives aimed at enhancing the positive impacts and minimising the negative impacts associated with this material topic. Caixa also measures and monitors various performance indicators in this chapter and/or in Annex B - GRI index, thereby enabling the effectiveness of the measures implemented to be assessed.

## Sustainability Management Model

The sustainability management model is cross-sectional to Caixa, with the most relevant structural bodies involved in executing the Corporate Sustainability Programme, as well as other structures (domestic and international) depending on the subjects under assessment.

This process includes the Sustainability Committee (CSU), chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, which as of 2022 will also include in its composition the Chief Risk Officer and the Chief Sustainability Officer (both executive directors). This guarantees the existence of a robust and transparent management model that promotes the development of cross-cutting ESG projects and the respective continuous monitoring by the administration. During 2022 the CSU held four meetings.
![img-165.jpeg](img-165.jpeg)

# Banco Nacional Ultramarino (Macau) - Governance Model 

Furthering and developing the Sustainability Strategy, BNU outlined an organisational structure and governance model to coordinate the ESG strategy, ensuring the alignment of the value proposition, business processes and practices and support operations, integrating sustainability principles into the Bank's decision-making processes.
![img-166.jpeg](img-166.jpeg)

## Caixa - E-procurement platform

The implementation of the e-procurement platform significantly changed the relationship between Caixa and its suppliers. All iterations, from registration, qualification and subsequent sourcing and contracting, are now carried out exclusively through this platform.

At an initial stage, the CSP invited current suppliers to register as potential Caixa suppliers and then go through a qualification process. This way, the Supplier Qualification Model was implemented with the inclusion of ESG criteria, which contributes to more efficient governance of ESG risks in the supply chain.

## Diversity in the management and supervisory bodies

Under the Portuguese Charter for Diversity, signed by Caixa, the concept of diversity is understood as the recognition, respect and appreciation of differences between people, including particularly those related to sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, belief, territory of origin, culture, language, nationality, place of birth, ancestry, age, political, ideological or social orientation, marital status, family, economic or health situation, disability, personal style and training.

Based on the Diversity Policy for Caixa Group employees and members of management and supervisory bodies, Caixa shall, among others, comply with the following applicable principles:

- Caixa's board of directors should be composed of members whose qualifications and background in terms of professional experience are diverse and balanced, enabling them to have appropriate knowledge of Caixa's activities and strategy;
- Caixa's management body should include people of diverse ages;
- Caixa's board of directors should include members with diverse and appropriate geographical origins in terms of their cultural background, qualifications and professional experience in relation to the Caixa Group's challenges and positioning;
- The proportion of persons of each gender appointed to Caixa's management and supervisory bodies must be equal to or greater than 33.3 per cent in each of these bodies.

# Caixa - Independence of non-executive directors 

In 2022 Caixa had 75\% independent non-executive directors.
The following non-executive directors are considered independent: António Alberto Henriques Assis, Monique Eugénie Hemerijck, Hans-Helmut Kotz, Arlindo Manuel Limede de Oliveira, Maria del Carmen Gil Marín, Maria João Martins Ferreira Major and Luis Filipe Nunes Coimbra Nazaret.

## Combating corruption and attempted bribery

As part of its internal control system, Caixa has implemented permanent measures to prevent and repress the crime of corruption and related offences, which are reflected in various internal procedures and regulations, including the Code of Conduct, the Policy on the Prevention of Corruption and Related Offences, the Global Policy on the Prevention and Management of Conflicts of Interest or the System for Internal Reporting of Irregular Practices. In addition to the instruments above, Caixa's internal control system also has specific mechanisms for the prevention and repression of offences that may be related to acts of corruption, such as money laundering, market abuse and breach of secrecy.

As set out in the Policy for the Prevention of Corruption and Related Offences, and in accordance with the Plan for the Prevention of Corruption and Related Offences, each structural body proceeds to identify the corruption risks associated with them, and to indicate the measures adopted to mitigate its occurrence. This Policy also contains information on how it is updated and monitored and identifies the people responsible for managing the plan. All Caixa structural bodies, as part of their area of intervention and with a view to continuous improvement, are responsible for adopting the initiatives necessary for its implementation.

The Policy for the Prevention of Corruption and Related Offences was revised in 2022, having identified new areas potentially more exposed to the phenomenon of corruption and related offences.

The revision of the Policy resulted from the new Plan for the Prevention of Corruption and Related Offences, which was prepared and published on Caixa's institutional website in 2022 and in which new areas potentially more exposed to the phenomenon of corruption and related offences were identified, with a decrease in the risk attributed to the areas carried over from the previous Plan.

It also includes measures to be implemented and action plans to mitigate Caixa's risk regarding this phenomenon. The implementation of these measures and actions will be monitored through the Plan Implementation Report, which in 2023 will become biannual.

A mandatory e-learning course on the Prevention of Corruption and Related Offences was also made available to all Caixa employees, also in 2022.

## Caixa - Management of risks of corruption and related infractions

At Caixa, the Policy for the Prevention of Corruption and Related Offences establishes as key principle the rejection of all forms of corruption and zero tolerance for any evidences or signs of the phenomenon. As such, the risks of corruption and related offences will be associated with all events that may jeopardise the objective of complying with this principle and acting in accordance with that Policy.

Risks are managed through the implementation of the plan for the prevention of corruption, which is updated incorporating the guidelines and recommendations issued by the relevant bodies and supervisory entities, as well as the new duties arising from the applicable legislation and regulations.

# Existing mechanisms for reporting irregular practices 

![img-167.jpeg](img-167.jpeg)

The Code of Conduct states that Caixa must provide an internal reporting circuit for alleged irregular practices occurring as part of its activity. Caixa has an Internal Reporting System for Irregular Practices (SCIPI), governed by its own internal regulations.

The internal regulations that govern this system aim to ensure, among other things, the existence of adequate means for reporting and dealing with irregular practices, ensuring the confidentiality of information and the identity of the whistleblower, when known.

Communications relating to the following topics may be carried out through the SCIPI:
a) Potential or actual breaches of Caixa's obligations under its financial intermediation activities, in particular those set out in Regulation (EU) no. 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council;
b) Offences or irregularities already committed, being committed or which, in the light of the available information, may be expected to be committed, concerning the following matters:
i. Financial instruments, public offers of securities, organised forms of trading of financial instruments, settlement and clearing systems, central counterparty, financial intermediation, credit securitisation companies, venture capital companies, venture capital funds or entities legally authorised to manage venture capital funds, insurance contracts linked to investment funds, individual membership contracts of open pension funds, risk rating and the regime of information and publicity concerning any of these matters;
ii. Entities operating regulated markets, multilateral or organised trading facilities, settlement systems, clearing houses, centralised securities systems, initial registration or administration of centralised registration systems, central counterparties or holding companies to these entities and providers of data communication services;
iii. The market abuse scheme.
c) Complaints related to the quote submission process that may compromise the integrity of the Euribor benchmark;
d) Serious irregularities concerning CGD's administration, accounting organisation and internal supervision;
e) Serious evidence of breaches of duties provided for in the General Framework for Credit Institutions and Financial Companies (RGICSF), namely regarding rules of conduct, customer relations, professional secrecy, own funds, reserves, corporate governance, internal capital, risks and duties of disclosure and information;
f) Serious evidence of breaches of duties provided for in Regulation (EU) no. 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council, in particular regarding own funds, risks, liquidity, leverage and disclosure of information;
g) Violations of Law no. 83/2017, of 18 August, establishing measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing;
h) Violations of the regulations implementing Law no. 83/2017, mentioned in the previous paragraph;

i) Violations of internally outlined policies, procedures and controls regarding the prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism, namely the Service Orders on Prevention of Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism, Prevention of Market Abuse, Prevention of Money Laundering - Entity Filtering System and Correspondent Banking.

In addition to the matters listed in the preceding paragraphs, anonymous reports made through the SCIPI on irregularities or violations of legal provisions or regulations produced by the supervisors with regard to the exercise of the banking activity or practice must also be admitted.

# Prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing phenomena 

Caixa is committed to best practices in the Prevention of Money Laundering and Combating Terrorism Financing (PML/CTF) and, in order to comply with current laws and regulations and the recommendations of the relevant international entities on this matter, it has developed and implemented a set of policies, procedures and control systems to assess and mitigate the possible risks inherent to its customers and the business relationships it established with them.

To this end, Caixa, through the Anti-Financial Crime Area of the Compliance Division, has several IT tools to monitor banking activity as part of PML/CTF, particularly apps dedicated to monitoring accounts and customers [performed continuously, systematically and in accordance with the indicators established on the basis of a Risk-Based Approach (RBA)], the classification of customers' risk profile and the filtering of sanctioned customers and politically exposed individuals.

In 2022, Caixa implemented a new research and business support application and changed its operating model to a digital process for the analysis of customer transactions under Law no. 83/2017, a strategic decision which enabled it to increase the operational effectiveness and efficiency levels, in addition to achieving a highly significant reduction in paper consumption and, consequently, optimising energy consumption, thereby increasing the sustainability levels in the PML/CTF activity.

Considering that all employees are required to know and comply with the legal and regulatory rules directly applicable to them in the performance of their duties, as well as of all internal rules and procedures established for the normal development of their activity, training videos were made available on the subject 'New legal PML/CFT obligations - Compliance Risk Opinions' and 'New legal PML/CFT obligations International Sanctions.

## BNU Timor - Anti-Money Laundering Training

![img-168.jpeg](img-168.jpeg)

The Office of the Prime Minister of East Timor, in collaboration with BNU Timor, conducted a training on antimoney laundering, which was held on 23 February 2022 and was delivered by the Compliance Officer of BNU Timor. The trainees that attended the session included officers from the National Intelligence Service (SNI), Customs Authority, East Timor Central Bank, Criminal Investigation Scientific Police (PCIC), National Criminal Investigation Scientific Police (PNCIC) and the Integrated Crisis Management Centre (CIGC).

# Banco Caixa Geral Angola - PML/TF 

In 2022 Banco Caixa Geral Angola developed training with the objective of enabling participants to identify potential suspicious situations and recognise the importance of adopting PML/TF measures, as well as remembering the obligations as a bank employee and knowing the objectives and applications of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) scheme.

The training is provided in the e-learning format and covers all employees of Banco Caixa Geral Angola. 325 employees were trained up to 31 December 2022, and the training is still active.

## Control mechanisms and procedures for the prevention and management of external fraud

The main goal of Caixa's External Fraud Prevention and Management action is to prevent and manage fraud incidents, in order to reduce Caixa's exposure to risk situations by adopting suitable containment/mitigation measures for the fraud incidents that occur.

In 2022, several fraud situations reported through internal channels and external entities were analysed, assessing the need to implement additional prevention measures as well as the existence of possible systemic effects and patterns of action in articulation with Caixa's structural bodies and/or relevant external entities for the identification of new patterns of behaviour, possible contamination of occurrences and new procedures to be adopted.

Caixa developed and implemented control mechanisms and procedures to mitigate the risk of (external) fraud, which translates into potential losses resulting from activities with fraudulent intent in its relations with customers and third parties, in direct coordination with the other units that make up the Anti-Financial Crime Area, with a view to preventing and combating different types of crime, especially money laundering and the financing of terrorism.

In the period in question, news, alerts or recommendations were also published with a view to monitoring trends and new fraud typologies, with the primary goal of containing incidents and preventing future situations.

## Monitoring and control of compliance risk in CGD Group's international structures

At Group Entities, the compliance function is independently ensured by local compliance structures, headed by Compliance Officers, who, in close cooperation with the Compliance Division, coordinate the management of compliance risk in the respective Caixa entities, reporting functionally to CGD's Head of Compliance, in line with the best high-level practices internationally established for the function.

To monitor and control the compliance risk in CGD Group's international structures, an Entity Compliance Monitoring and Reporting Model was established, comprising the activities performed by the Compliance Division for the effective monitoring of the Entities, as well as the obligations of the Entities to the Compliance Division, particularly with regard to compliance with the reporting duties on the various compliance topics that must be accompanied and monitored by the parent company, ensuring the reliability and timeliness of the information reported.

The main objectives of the Entity Compliance Monitoring and Reporting Model are to ensure the effective supervision of the group's entities, to allow a continuous assessment and monitoring of the group entities' risks, to contribute to the timely adoption of corporate policies, to promote the timely resolution of compliance risk deficiencies, and to increase control and monitoring of the execution of the annual compliance plan and budget.

To achieve those objectives, we highlight the permanent monitoring and risk assessment activities, the resolution of deficiencies with a compliance risk and the management of policy changes.

The Compliance Division outlined a model that allows assessing a set of legal and regulatory requirements and best practices applicable to compliance at an international level, regularly visiting the CGD Group entities in order to assess the degree of compliance risk management. These requirements are organised by major topics, and, within each topic, specific issues are identified, thus making it possible to structure the diagnosis made by the Parent Company. As a result of the assessment carried out, each entity is given an overall mark of its degree of compliance, which will allow for conclusions to be drawn on the Group's risk profile, as well as for the identification of possible weaknesses and opportunities for improvement that will strengthen the organisational culture and the risk management, governance and internal control systems with regard to compliance risk.

The Compliance Division records the compliance risk weaknesses of the entities identified by the authorities and supervisory bodies, the internal and external audits and the on-site compliance visits made to the entities. Each weakness is assigned a level of risk, a deadline for implementation of the action plan associated with it, as well as the person responsible for implementing the action plan, with a view to its regular follow-up and timely resolution, in accordance with the Corporate Policy for the Management of Internal Control Deficiencies applicable to the entire Group.

As part of the corporate competencies of the Compliance Division, it is responsible for disseminating the ethical culture and the CGD Group's operating principles, as well as for disseminating the best operating practices for the compliance function and fostering the sharing of experiences and communication between the various Group entities, as well as helping Caixa entities to adopt internal corporate standards and monitor their transposition. In order to achieve that objective, it is necessary to define the corporate regulations regarding the compliance function, as well as the entities that must transpose those regulations and the maximum deadline for transposition. Each entity is responsible for transposing the corporate regulations ensuring their adaptation to the legal and regulatory requirements of their jurisdiction. All corporate regulations for the compliance function must be approved by the Head of Compliance prior to their approval and subsequent publication, thus contributing to the implementation of a coherent compliance function pursuant to the internal rules and procedures outlined for the entire Group.

# Caixa - Training on Compliance Risk Assessment 

In 2022, Caixa provided the Compliance Officers of CGD Group entities with training on Compliance Risk Assessment - Methodology and operationalisation, compliance visits and compliance tests. Training was also provided on the preparation of reports aimed at responding to the obligations imposed by Notice no. 3/2020 of the Bank of Portugal.

## Caixa - Assessment of suppliers and service providers

The Code of Conduct requires Caixa to adopt instruments, namely contractual instruments, that show its suppliers' and other counterparties' commitment to the ethical principles and best business practices to which it subscribes. Caixa's suppliers contractually adhere to the Declaration of Ethical Principles and Best Business Practices, binding themselves to standards of conduct with regard to compliance with laws and regulations, corporate governance practices, the prevention of conflicts of interest and financial crimes, labour obligations and preservation of the environment and sustainability.

Service providers are also assessed, and this assessment will be extended to all suppliers in the second half of 2022, in relation to various risks, including compliance risks. In this context, opinions are issued by the Compliance Division which cover matters of ethics and conduct.

# 4.12. Disclosure of sustainability information 

Stakeholders (customers, employees, investors, suppliers, and tertiary sector, among others) are paying increasing attention to how companies integrate ESG factors into their business strategies and operations, accompanied by an increase in the development and level of demand of laws and regulations that will require companies to disclose more transparent and relevant non-financial information.

Caixa considers it imperative to make regular, transparent disclosures on ESG performance in accordance with the best reporting and regulatory practices, supplemented by multi-sector partnerships that mobilise and share knowledge, enabling a global approach to sustainable development.

Caixa has therefore been developing a reporting approach based on the principle that each stakeholder has specific information needs and as such the content, format and channels of communication must be adapted to provide a transparent and efficient view of the institution's ESG performance.

Caixa's Sustainability Report is positioned as a highly relevant instrument for stakeholders requiring more complete and detailed information such as investors, regulators or supervisors. For this reason Caixa has been adopting the use of the main frameworks on sustainability issues, such as the Global Reporting Initiative or the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.

The Sustainability Report is also relevant for the alignment with:

- The reporting requirements defined by the Technical Unit for Supervising and Monitoring the State's Business Sector (UTAM), namely the company's sustainability analysis in the economic, social and environmental areas;
- The response to the non-financial statement set out in Commercial Companies Code - Disclosure of non-financial information and diversity information by large companies and groups;
- CMVM's voluntary recommendations for disclosure of non-financial information by companies issuing securities admitted to trading on a regulated market;
- Global commitments and initiatives on sustainability issues, such as the 10 Principles of the United Nations Global Compact and the Sustainable Development Goals.

Considering the needs of other stakeholders who prefer more visual and summarised information, Caixa also began to publish an annual Sustainability Brochure, which highlights the main projects and initiatives disclosed in the annual Sustainability Report.

## Caixa - Position paper

Caixa has also been publishing specific documentation on priority topics for sustainable development, namely climate action.

In this context, we highlight the publication of the Position Paper - Climate Action. This document, of a more technical nature, shares a set of very relevant information for various stakeholder groups, such as the results of Caixa's first calculation process regarding the scope 3 - category 15 greenhouse gas emissions. For a financial institution, category 15 emissions (investments) most often represent the most significant component of their GHG emissions inventory.

This document was shared directly with 789 investors from 474 companies.

# SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE EVALUATION BY EXTERNAL ENTITIES 

Caixa regularly responds to different external sustainability indices in order to objectively and transparently assess its ESG performance; this is one of the areas of action of the 'Disclosure of Sustainability Information' pillar of the 2021-2024 Sustainability Strategy.

The sustainability ratings are highly important to companies because they assess their level of exposure to ESG risks, as well as their ability to mitigate those risks and contribute to sustainable development.

Being assessed by external entities, Caixa promotes a practice of transparency and a concrete response to the expectations of various stakeholders, such as investors, who favour the integration of ESG criteria into their investment decisions.

Below we highlight some of Caixa's achievements.
Sustainability ratings and indexes

## SUSTAINALYTICS

a Morningstar company

The ESG Risk Rating from Sustainalytics (a Morningstar company) measures the institution's exposure to ESG risks, weighted by sector of activity, by assessing the ESG Risk Exposure and Risk Management dimensions in different areas of activity.

Caixa achieved a Medium Risk rating (20.2) in 2022. This result places Caixa in the top $22 \%$ of banks assessed, namely in the $220^{\text {th }}$ position out of a world universe of 992 companies (data as at 14/12/2022).

This rating demonstrates Caixa's solidity in both ESG risk dimensions and respective associated criteria, particularly in terms of the results obtained in Corporate Governance (negligible risk), ESG Integration Financials (low risk) and Human Capital (low risk).
![img-169.jpeg](img-169.jpeg)

CDP is an international non-profit organisation that provides one of the most recognised and comprehensive environmental disclosure systems, aiming to promote the transition of the business sector to a low-carbon economy.

This assessment is an important tool to identify and assess climate risks and opportunities associated with its activity. Performance levels are divided into Disclosure (D- and D), Awareness (C- and C), Management (B- and B) and Leadership (A- and A).

Caixa achieved a Management (B) rating in the Climate Change 2022 questionnaire, this result being higher than the financial sector average (B-). It is important to underline that of the 12 categories assessed CGD scored above average in 11 of them.

Caixa's response can be found on the CDP website or on the Caixa institutional website (https://www.cgd.pt/English/Sustainability-CGD/Performance/Pages/External-Assessments.aspx).

## Caixa - CDP Forests score report 2022

Complementarily to CDP's Climate Change questionnaire, Caixa participated for the first time in the CDP Forest, a questionnaire on forestry risk management and practices.

Caixa achieved a (B) rating, which is higher than the average of the financial sector (C) and the overall average (C). Caixa scored above average in the six components assessed in the questionnaire, namely: risks \& opportunities; risk management processes; portfolio impact; governance; engagement and business strategy \& financial planning.

# Alignment with regulatory requirements 

European ESG regulations have evolved significantly over the last few years, through the development of laws, regulations and guidelines that will be key to aligning the financial sector with the goals of the European Green Deal).

Caixa has been monitoring the evolution of the regulatory context and acting proactively through internal interdepartmental action, whose main developments are monitored by the Sustainability Committee.

## Sustainable Taxonomy

With increased exposure to acute (e.g. heat waves/wind) and chronic (e.g. rise in mean sea level) physical climate risks, the European Commission has developed a regulatory response that aims to incorporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) into investment decision-making, with the aim of boosting sustainable finance in financial markets.

The European Union Taxonomy, hereinafter referred to as 'Taxonomy Regulation' or 'Taxonomy', aims to establish a mechanism to identify environmentally sustainable economic activities together with Directive 2014/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (i.e., Non-Financial Reporting Directive - NFRD). In this regard, article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation obliges organisations covered by the NFRD to disclose how and to what extent their economic activities are eligible and aligned with the Taxonomy. These two concepts introduced by the Taxonomy are established as follows:

- An economic activity is eligible if it contributes substantially to at least one of the six environmental goals underlying the Taxonomy, irrespective of whether the activity meets the technical criteria set out in the delegated acts;
- An economic activity is considered to be aligned with the taxonomy when is confirmed 1) the significant contribution of this eligible economic activity to at least one of the environmental goals, based on the technical criteria specified through the delegated acts. 2) compliance with the Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) principle; and 3) compliance with minimum safeguards.

Article 10(3) of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 of the Commission, which applies from 1 January 2022 to financial institutions, aims to identify the economic activities eligible for the environmental goals set out in article 9(a)(b) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament (i.e. climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation). As such, the information available in this report is intended to meet the disclosure requirements imposed by that article.

Whereas the regulation for disclosure of information does not establish any pre-set template structure, Caixa has outlined a content and reporting structure which can be analysed in the following section.

## Eligibility Analysis

The analysis of the assets portfolio considers the consolidated assets of the CGD Group. Therefore, the assets covered by the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) include all assets that they consolidate in the Group, with the exception of assets that are excluded from the calculation of the indicator, these being exposures to central banks, supranational issuers and central governments, as described in article 7(1) of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 of the Commission. In the table below, it is possible to see the proportion of assets considered in the eligibility calculation (assets covered by the indicator).

The information sources used for this analysis were the consolidated FINREP with a reference date of December 2022, the list of products associated with consumer credit from Caixa's 'green' financing lines and the list of NFRD entities.

| Assets | Book value (M€) | Proportion |
| :-- | :--: | :--: |
| Total assets covered by the indicator | 60,155 | $58.78 \%$ |
| Exposures to central banks, supranational <br> issuers and central governments | 42,190 | $41.22 \%$ |
| Total CGD Group assets | 102,345 | $100 \%$ |

The table below shows the composition of the covered assets at Group level. The table is distributed over the asset breakdowns required for Green Asset Ratio reporting by both the Taxonomy and Pillar 3 prudential disclosures:

Total proportion in monetary units and percentage value of the hedged assets portfolio

| Assets | Book value (M€) | Proportion | Of which, for sectors eligible under Taxonomy (M€) | \% of eligible assets 2022 | \% of eligible assets 2021 ${ }^{14}$ |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Assets covered in both numerator and denominator | 36,715 | 61.03\% | 28.768 | 46.16\% | 50,17\% |
| - Financial institutions | 4,590 | 7.63\% | - | - | - |
| - Credit institutions | 3,647 |  | - | - | - |
| - Other financial institutions | 943 |  | - | - | - |
| - Non-financial institutions required to disclose NFRD | 1,501 | 2.50\% | 0 | 0.72\% | 0.36\% |
| - Households | 30,623 | 50.91\% | - | - | 49.81\% |
| - Mortgages | 27,768 |  | 27,768 | 46.16\% | - |
| - Credit for consumption + other | 2,856 |  | 0.577 | 0.00\% | - |
| Assets excluded from the numerator for the purposes of calculating the key performance indicator | 23,440 | 38.97\% | - | - | - |
| - Non-financial institutions not required to report NFRD | 18,078 | 30.05\% | - | - | - |
| - Derivatives | 52 | 0.09\% | - |  | - |
| - Exposure to interbank loans | 574 | 0.95\% | - | - | - |
| - Cash and cash equivalents and demand deposits | 652 | 1.08\% | - | - | - |
| - Other assets (e.g. goodwill, other tangible assets, etc.) | 4,084 | 6.79\% | - | - | - |
| Total assets covered, i.e. covered by the indicator | 60,155 | 100.00\% | - | - | - |

In accordance with Article 7(2)(3), (EU) 2021/2139 exposures related to derivatives and counterparties not subject to non-financial reporting are excluded from the numerator by (EU) 2013/34.

Additionally, and according to the October 2022 clarifications (2022/C 385/01) ${ }^{15}$, positions of 'Cash and cash equivalents and demand deposits' and 'Other assets' are not considered in the numerator, since it is not feasible to assess their eligibility as it is not clear to which economic activity these assets are allocated.

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{14}$ For the reporting of the 2021 taxonomy, the FINREP with reference year December 2020 was used, considering that at the date of the exercise for the previous year, the FINREP with reference year December 2021 had not yet been concluded.
    15 Communication from the Commission on the interpretation of certain legal provisions of the Delegated Disclosure Act under Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation on the reporting of eligible economic activities and goods.

To identify the positions eligible for EU Taxonomy, the total value was considered for mortgages, the amounts regarding environmental financing lines in consumer credit and positions whose counterparts are subject to NFRD - companies listed in European regulated markets, credit institutions, insurance companies, with more than 500 employees - associated with the eligible NACE's established in the regulation.

It should be noted that eligibility for the EU Taxonomy indicates whether investments are linked to activities that can substantially contribute to climate change mitigation or adaptation, but not to what extent they do so.

In addition to calculating the indicators as at December 2022, the CGD Group performed the exercise of evaluating these indicators (in relation to December 2021), having obtained the figures shown below:

Eligibility Indicators 2021 and 2022

| Indicators | \% of total <br> assets - 2022 | \% of total assets <br> - 2021 |
| :-- | :--: | :--: |
| Proportion of Taxonomy-eligible economic activities over <br> total assets ${ }^{16}$; | $46.16 \%$ | $50.17 \%$ |
| Proportion over total assets of exposures to central <br> banks, supranational issuers and central governments | $41.22 \%$ | $34.07 \%$ |
| Proportion over total assets of exposure to derivatives; | $0.05 \%$ | $0.01 \%$ |
| Proportion over total assets of exposures to companies <br> that are not required to publish non-financial information; | $17.66 \%$ | $18.18 \%$ |
| Proportion on total assets of trading portfolio exposures; | $1.05 \%$ | $4.48 \%$ |
| Proportion over total assets of interbank lending <br> exposures; | $0.56 \%$ | $0.76 \%$ |

The table shows the evolution of the Eligibility indicators between 2022 and 2021, where there is a decrease in the proportion of eligible economic activities to the Taxonomy over the total assets, compared to the previous year. However it is important to highlight some aspects:

- There was an adjustment in the way of calculation regarding the year 2021, where the totality of assets was considered to calculate the proportion of eligible assets. In 2022, only covered assets were considered.
- In the analysis of Taxonomy 2022, the values relative to financing lines of environmental scope in consumer credits were considered;
- The total value of assets increased from 2021 to 2022, from 91,284 M€ to 102,345 M€, with the covered amount increasing from 56,099 M€ to 60,155 M€, respectively, which leads to a decrease in the proportions, however, the eligible amount increased from 28,143 M€ to 28,202 M€;
- The eligible amount of non-financial companies subject to NFRD disclosure increased in 2022 from 201 M€ to 434 M€ compared to the previous year.

Disclosure of sustainability-related information in the financial services sector.
Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, of 27 November 2019, on the disclosure of sustainability-related information in the financial services sector sets out certain harmonised transparency rules applicable to financial market participants and financial advisors, with the aim of achieving greater transparency on how financial market participants take into account sustainability risks in their investment decisions or investment advisory activities.

The Socially Responsible Investment Policy aims to comply with the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 27 November 2019, on sustainability- related disclosures in the financial services sector.

Accordingly, this Policy frames the nature of the various products managed by Caixa Gestão de Ativos, which promote, among others, environmental or social characteristics and which, under the regulation, may

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{16}$ Covered assets are considered to be all assets included in the calculation of the numerator and denominator of the KPI.

correspond to the terms of articles 6 and 8 of the aforementioned regulation, as explained in the precontractual information for each product. Furthermore, the Socially Responsible Investment Policy also extends, under the same terms, to the discretionary management and investment advisory services provided by Caixa Gestão de Ativos.

Accordingly, with reference to December 2022, Caixa Gestão de Ativos, notwithstanding the fact that it incorporates ESG criteria in the entirety of its assets, we highlight the total amount of EUR 5.9 billion in openended securities investment funds and pension funds under management that promote social and/or environmental features and comply with all the assumptions in the SRI Policy, of the Caixa Geral de Depósitos Group management companies - Caixa Gestão de Ativos, SGOIC, SA and CGD Pensões, SGFP, SA - (article 8 in light of European Regulation 2019/2088). This amount comprises EUR 5.2 billion in securities investment funds, EUR 191 million in Open Pension Funds and EUR 537 million in UCITS Retirement Pension Funds.

|  GOVERNANCE |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |
|  2-9 | Governance structure and composition | The governance model adopted by Caixa corresponds to the 'dual' or 'Anglo-Saxon' model structured in accordance with the provisions of articles 278 (1)(b) and 423-B of the CSC and article 3 of the RUSA. Caixa's governance structure comprises a Board of Directors (BoD) and, as regards supervision, an Audit Committee and a Statutory Audit Firm (SROC). The Internal Regulation of the Board of Directors foresees the possibility of creating special standing committees composed of some of its members, whenever deemed convenient and appropriate, delegating the exercise of certain specific | - | - | - | - | SDG 16 - Peace, justice and strong institutions | -  |

|  functions to them. The main mission of the special committees is to carry out specific and permanent monitoring of the matters entrusted to them, in order to ensure informed decision-making processes by the Board of Directors. | |
| --- | --- |
|  The activity of the committees is monitored by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, who ensures their adequate coordination with the activity of the plenary of that body, through the respective Chairmen, who must keep him/her informed, namely concerning the activities they develop. The special committees of the Board of Directors are as follows: | |
|  • Risk Committee (CR): | |
|  • Appointment, Assessment and Remuneration Committee (CNAR). | |
|  Committees responsible for decision-making most notably include the Audit Committee (supervisory body), the Risk Committee and the Executive Committee (body responsible for the daily management of the institution). The Sustainability Committee is responsible for monitoring the organisation's impact on the economy, the environment and people. Additional information available in Chapter 3. Corporate Governance Report = 3.5. Corporate bodies and commissions. | |
|  The Board of Directors consists of a suitable and sufficient number of members, taking into account, in particular, the structure and size of the institution and the complexity of the risks inherent to its activity. The Non-Executive Directors perform activities of continuous supervision and assessment of the Company's management, forming part of the various Special Committees of the Board of Directors and ensuring the effective monitoring, supervision and assessment of the activity of the Executive Members, thereby efficiently and effectively fulfilling their assigned | |

|   |  | duties. The composition of the management body shall reflect the knowledge, skills and experience required to perform its duties, namely those set forth in the Policy for Assessing Adequacy for Selecting Management and Supervisory Bodies, Key Function Holders and Managers of the Branches established Abroad and in the Succession Plan. This implies for the management body to have, collectively, an adequate understanding of the areas for which its members are collectively responsible, as well as the of skills to effectively manage and supervise the institution.
As regards diversity in the Board of Directors, Caixa is firmly committed to a growing balance of gender representation and parity in its composition and to provide a balance between knowledge, skills, qualifications and professional experience. Caixa complies with the dictates of Law no. 62/2017 as regards the goals and targets for the balanced representation of women and men in management and supervisory bodies and, in 2019, approved the Diversity Policy for Caixa Group Employees and Members of Caixa's Management and Supervisory Bodies, which outlines and establishes the principles applicable in terms of diversity to the transversality of its Employees, including members of its corporate bodies. |  |  |  |  |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  2-10 | Nomination and selection of the highest governance body | The process of identifying skills and qualifications for the selection of candidates to join the Board of Directors is provided for in the Succession Plan for members of the management body and holders of key functions (Succession Plan), which also aims to ensure the continuity of Caixa's management in order to avoid the replacement of an excessive number of members of the management body at the same time.
The process of proposing candidates to the governing bodies is based on the following assumptions: |  |  |  | SDG 16 - Peace, justice and strong institutions |   |

|   |  | - Continuity of at least three directors with executive duties and three directors with nonexecutive duties, in accordance with the shareholder's commitment to the ECB, based on the adequacy reassessment and performance assessment of the directors in office;
- Mention of the members who indicated that they were unavailable to remain in office;
- Selection of potential internal and external candidates, identified according to the collective matrix of executive and non-executive profiles in the Succession Plan;
- Promotion of an increase in the number of persons of the under-represented gender on the Board of Directors, by directors with both executive and non-executive duties. The proportion should be set at around one third, in accordance with the applicable legislation;
- Confidentiality. |  |  |  |  |   |

|  2-12 | Role of the highest governance body in overseeing impact management | The management and decision-making process regarding sustainability topics, such as the outlining of the Strategy and approval of Policies, are matters for the Board of Directors. In addition to the responsibilities associated with the Board of Directors, the role of the Executive Committee and of some relevant Committees should also be noted:
1) Executive Committee: responsible for decisionmaking on the main sustainability projects and overseeing the progress achieved by the Sustainability Strategy;
2) Governance Committee: made up of members with non-executive duties, its function is to analyse, monitor and advise on matters such as corporate governance, ethics and conduct, conflicts of interest, social responsibility, sustainability and sustainable funding; | - | - | - | SDG 16 - Peace, justice and strong institutions | C. Main risk factors  |

|   |  | 3) Sustainability Committee: an advisory body to the Executive Committee that oversees the management and guides decisions on the implementation of the Sustainability Strategy, incorporating the principles of sustainable development, responsible banking and sustainable finance in Caixa's day-to-day activities, in alignment with the institution's Strategic Plan and stakeholders' expectations.
As a result of the materiality analysis process conducted by Caixa Geral de Depósitos, a 20212024 Sustainability Strategy was outlined which aims to boost positive impacts and minimise negative impacts in terms of Sustainability and ESG. As part of this, each year an annual Sustainability Report is developed which presents the main results and developments in this area and whose approval is the responsibility of the Board of Directors.
The control, supervision and regular diligence functions to ensure compliance with the governance model in Sustainability matters, as well as the means and resources for efficient and effective performance, are performed by members of the Board of Directors who are members of the Sustainability Committee, with the support of Caixa's internal teams, which include various internal structures such as the Corporate Support Division (sustainability area), the Risk Management Division and the Compliance Division (DC).
The Sustainability Committee held four meetings in 2022. |  |  |  |  |  |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  2-13 | Delegation of responsibility for managing impact | 'Sustainability and social impact' as one of the six areas of the 2021 - 2024 strategic plan requires regular, effective monitoring by CGD management. In 2022 Dr. Maria João Carioca, Executive Director of CGD, was appointed Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), a position she | - | - | - | - | SDG 16 - Peace, justice and strong institutions | C. Main risk factors  |

|   |  | combines with that of Chief Financial Officer (CFO). The CSO is responsible for leading CGD's sustainability area and overseeing the 2021 - 2024 sustainability strategy and its impact on the ESG dimensions. This is a member of CGD's Board of Directors sitting on the Sustainability Committee, along with the Chairman of the Executive Committee, who chairs the committee, the Director with the Chief Risk Officer (CRO role) and the Director responsible for a commercial area.
The Sustainability Committee meets at least quarterly (or when convened by the Director chairing the Committee) and additionally:
- Addresses to the attention of the Governance Committee the annual planning and compliance with the Sustainability Strategy;
- Reports to the Governance Committee on the outcome of the meetings;
- Submits to the Executive Committee for appraisal matters identified as structural, important to CGD's evolution and/or any recommendations and future developments.
The Chief Sustainability Officer also chairs the internal working group on sustainable funding. |  |  |  |  |   |

|  $2-14$ | Role of the highest governance body in sustainability reporting | The Management Report and Accounts of CGD's individual and consolidated activity shall be completed and approved by the Board of Directors (including the issue of the opinions of the Statutory Auditors and the Audit Committee by the end of April following the year covered by the Report).
In addition, the 2022 Sustainability Report drafting process is regularly monitored in various internal forums, in particular the Sustainability Committee and the Governance Committee.
The Sustainability Report has a specific chapter with the presentation of material topics as well as |  |  |  | SDG 16 - Peace, justice and strong institutions |   |

|   |  | the management approach to address these issues. |  |  |  |  |  |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  2-15 | Conflicts of interest | The identification, prevention and management of conflicts of interest or potential conflicts of interest ensure the exercise of functions with independence, including independence of mind. In particular, the members of the management and supervisory bodies are fully aware that they may not intervene in the assessment and decision of transactions in which they, their spouses, or persons with whom they live in a de facto union, relatives or kin to the first degree, or companies or other legal entities that they directly or indirectly control, under the terms laid down in articles 85 and 86 of the RGICSF, have direct or indirect interest. Article 410 (6) of the Commercial Companies Code also states that directors may not vote on matters in which, for their own account or on behalf of a third party, they have an interest in conflict with that of the company.
The verification of the existence of situations that generate or may generate conflicts of interest for members of the management and supervisory bodies occurs in the process of assessment by Caixa and ECB authorisation for the exercise of functions as a member of the Board of Directors or supervisory body and must be verified on an ongoing basis and at least annually, which occurs through the annual processes of reassessment of individual suitability described above. The Global Policy characterises the events in which there are situations of conflict or potential conflict of interests, establishes a conflict-of-interest materiality matrix and lists the mitigation measures. It also sets out the mechanisms and procedures for reporting and recording identified situations, as well as the bodies that shall assess and decide on the matter. | - | - | - | - | SDG 16 - Peace, justice and strong institutions | D.

|   |  | Caixa discloses relevant information as part of this to its stakeholders, such as the independence of the members of the Board of Directors. |  |  |  |  |  |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  2-16 | Communication of critical concerns | Procedures and mechanisms have been established and implemented for the immediate reporting of matters with a potential impact on CGD's activity to the governance bodies, such as the Code of Conduct, the Policy for the Prevention of Corruption and Related Offences, the Global Policy for the Prevention and Management of Conflicts of Interest and the Internal Reporting of Irregular Practices System (SCIPI). Specifically, the SCIPI adopted by CGD aims, among others, to (i) detect potential offences in advance, fostering a preventive and corrective attitude and a culture of integrity; (ii) provide a communication channel that allows voluntary, confidential and anonymous communication of facts and signs of irregular practices, as explained in the regulations; (iii) provide an internal reporting channel on irregular practices for compliance by CGD with the obligations arising from the Code of Obligations of Panel Banks (COPB), which is an integral part of the Euribor Code of Conduct; (iv) reduce costs and avoid losses due to noncompliance with legal, regulatory or conduct standards, protecting the legitimate interests of all stakeholders; (iv) reinforce a reputation for transparency and align with international best practices in corporate governance; (v) comply with obligations laid down in national and Community legislation. The SCIPI establishes the characteristics, handling of communication, communication circuit, parties and reporting.
There are also procedures in place for handling, following up, resolving and reporting to the governing bodies situations of non-compliance detected and customer complaints, as well as for preventing and managing the risk of fraud (internal and external). | - | - | - | - | SDG 16 - Peace, justice and strong institutions | C.

|   |  | Finally, we would like to highlight the corporate standard 'CGD Group Internal Control System Principles of Governance and Disability Management Policy', which regulates the governance and management of internal control deficiencies model across the CGD Group.
During 2022, no concerns were reported to the governance bodies that were considered crucial, i.e., communications about potential and actual negative impacts of the organisation on stakeholders raised through complaint mechanisms. |  |  |  |  |   |

|  $2-17$ | Collective knowledge of the highest governance body | In 2022, Caixa launched a specific e-learning on sustainability issues which is mandatory for all its employees. The main objective of this training module is to provide a comprehensive understanding of this topic and simultaneously promote the greater alignment of organisational culture and practices. On 31/12/2022 the 'Sustainability - A strategic approach' e-learning reached a completion rate of $85.7 \%$.
In 2022, under the Permanent Education Programme (PEP), two sessions were held with the participation of external specialists, aimed at all members of the Board of Directors, managers of foreign units (Branches and Banks), Central Managers and other employees whose functions are directly or indirectly related to the Sustainability topic.

the highest
governance
body | The Appointment, Assessment and
Remuneration Committee (CNAR) assesses the
structure, size, composition and performance of
the management body and the supervisory body
and, when it sees fit, makes recommendations to
them. The process briefly comprises the following
stages: (i) approval by the managing body, upon
a recommendation of CNAR, of the model to be
adopted for the purpose of the evaluation process
of the collective performance of the management
bodies and the individual performance of their
members; (ii) compilation and collection of the
documentation to be prepared by the members of
the management body and the supporting
information for the assessment process (such as
attendance lists at meetings of the governing
bodies, the key performance indicators (KPI) of
the executive members of the Board of Directors,
and the data referring to compliance with the
Strategic Plan for the 2021-2024 period); (iii)
sending by the DSC of the toolkit to the members
of the Board of Directors, and request of the
respective self-assessment and of the opinion of
the Chairmen of the Board of Directors, the
Executive Committee and the Special
Committees about the qualitative performance of
the members of the managing body; (iv) upon
receipt of the responses, drafts of the collective
and individual performance appraisal reports are
prepared by the DSC, which the CNAR appraises;
(v) evaluation of the collective assessment reports
of the Board of Directors, the Executive
Committee and the Special Committees by the
Board of Directors. The process is replicated with
the necessary adaptations to the Audit
Committee. | - | - | - | - | SDG 16 - Peace,

|   |  | The intervention of an independent external entity
will require: (i) the preparation of the proposal for
the requirements to be included in the
specifications supporting the launch of the market
consultation and identification of potential
candidates; (ii) CNAR's consideration of the
proposed requirements that will form the basis of
the market consultation for hiring an external |  |  |  |  |   |

|   |  | entity; (iii) the Board of Directors' consideration of the proposed requirements; (iv) the analysis of the applicants' proposals by CNAR and preparation of its recommendation for the selection of the external assessment entity; (vii) the consideration of CNAR's proposal by the Board of Directors and selection of the independent candidate.
The recommendations resulting from the Board Effectiveness Review are implemented through a plan and timetable for that purpose. |  |  |  |  |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  2-19 | Remuneration policy | The Remuneration Policy in force takes into consideration, namely, the following goals and requirements set forth in its article 7:
a) Ensure compliance with the applicable legal and regulatory provisions, namely the Legal Framework for Credit Institutions and Financial Companies, the European Banking Authority (EBA) Guidelines, Regulation (EU) no. 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council;
b) Promote and be consistent with a sound and prudent risk management of the CGD Group;
c) Not to encourage risk-taking above the level of risk tolerated by CGD and the CGD Group (risk appetite);
d) Be compatible with the strategy, goals, values and long-term interests of the CGD Group, as established by its competent corporate bodies;
e) Avoid situations of conflict of interests;
f) Structure remuneration mechanisms that take into account and are appropriate and proportional to the nature, characteristics, size, organisation and complexity of CGD Group's activities;
g) Promote the pursuit of the activity in compliance with the risk appetite established for the CGD Group (risk appetite statement);
h) Promote the competitiveness of CGD and the CGD Group, taking into account the remuneration policies and practices of banks and institutions comparable to CGD.
I - Fixed and variable remuneration: The remuneration of Executive Directors is composed of a fixed component and a variable component, |  |  |  | SDG 16 - Peace, justice and strong institutions |   |

|   | the latter of which is not guaranteed. The amount of the variable remuneration may not exceed that of the fixed remuneration, in order to ensure that the fixed portion represents a proportion of the overall remuneration of Executive Directors that is high enough to allow enforcing a fully flexible policy in relation to the variable portion, including the possibility of none being paid. The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is exclusively composed of a fixed component. (Section IV of the Policy). <br> II - Attraction Bonus: Remuneration paid as compensation to any new member of the Board of Directors for the termination of previous functions must take into account the long-term interests of CGD, including the application of rules on performance, unavailability due to retention, deferral and reduction and reversal mechanisms. (Point 23.2 of the Policy). <br> III - Termination Payments: In the event of dismissal or early termination of duties of any member of the Board of Directors or of CGD's supervisory body, there shall be no payment of any indemnity or compensation other than that provided for in the applicable legal provisions, it being the responsibility of CRAG to set the maximum amount of all compensation payable to members of the Board of Directors and the Supervisory Board due to termination of duties. (Point 23.1 of the Policy). <br> IV - Clawback: The variable component of remuneration may be subject to reduction or reversal, by resolution of the General Meeting, upon proposal of CRAG: <br> a) According to the evolution of CGD's Strategic Plan in force; <br> b) If the multiannual assumptions outlined for the attribution of the variable remuneration component are not met; <br> c) If CRAG concludes, after consulting CNAR, that the Executive Director: <br> (i) Participated in or was responsible for an action that resulted in significant losses for CGD; <br> (ii) No longer meets the suitability and reputation criteria. (Point 16.3 of the Policy).  |
| --- | --- |
|  |   |

V - Retirement Benefits: Executive Directors may enjoy the benefits, namely as regards social benefits and pensions, under the terms fulfilled by the General Meeting or by CRAG, taking into consideration the practice that has been followed at CGD, as well as the remuneration policies and practices of other banks and institutions comparable to CGD. (Point 22.)

Pursuant to the Remuneration Policy, the total amount of the variable remuneration of the Executive Directors as a whole may not exceed the maximum percentage of consolidated net profits for the year as outlined by the General Meeting for each year, following a proposal submitted by the Remuneration Committee of the General Meeting (CRAG). The setting of this amount must take into account CGD's ability to maintain a solid equity base, its overall performance and results, the evolution of the overall amount set for the variable remuneration of CGD's employees as a whole and in accordance with the best practices of other banks and institutions comparable to CGD. (Point 10.3). The determination of the actual amount of the variable component to be attributed to each Executive Director is performed by CRAG, taking into account the evaluation of the individual performance of each Executive Director by reference to the financial year and the period of time elapsed since the beginning of the respective mandate. (Point 13.1)

The evaluation provided for in the previous section shall be carried out:
a) In a multiannual framework, so that the assessment process is based on long-term performance and the payment of the remuneration components dependent thereon is spread over a period that takes into account CGD's underlying business cycle and its business risks; b) Takes into account quantitative criteria measured by the evolution of the execution of CGD's Strategic Plan in force, within the risk appetite framework approved for the Group. (Point 13.2) The criteria set for determining and

|   |  | assigning the variable remuneration component may be reviewed by the General Meeting, which determines the variable remuneration, at the proposal of CRAG, after consulting CNAR, in order to ensure that the variable remuneration considers the various types of current and future risks, as well as the cost of maintaining a solid base of own funds and liquidity required for CGD to perform its activity. The variable remuneration component may be subject to reduction or reversal by resolution of the General Meeting, upon a proposal of CRAG, depending, namely, on the evolution of CGD's Strategic Plan in force. (Point 16.) |  |  |  |  |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  2-20 | Process to determine remuneration | The Remuneration Policy is established by the Shareholder, upon proposal of the Remuneration Committee of the General Meeting, taking into consideration the proposals made by the Appointment, Assessment and Remuneration Committee (CNAR), guidelines of the regulatory authorities and the best corporate governance practices applicable to financial institutions. The determination of the fixed component of the remuneration is the responsibility of the CRAG, in accordance with the competences required and the responsibilities inherent to the positions to be held and the time spent by the members of these corporate bodies exercising their functions, namely considering the remuneration practice of comparable institutions.
The total amount of the variable remuneration component to be attributed to the executive members of the Board of Directors, depending on performance, shall be determined, upon proposal of CRAG, at the Annual General Meeting or subsequent resolution of the shareholder.
Information on the process for setting the value of variable remuneration and determining the specific amount is presented in GRI indicator 219.

|  2-23 | Policy commitments | The Policies and commitments regarding sustainability are detailed in Chapter 4. Sustainability Report - 4.5. Policies, commitments and working groups
With regard to specific human rights policies, we highlight the Statement of Commitment to Human Rights, a document that aims to reinforce CGD's commitment to respecting internationally recognised human rights in the development of its relations with employees, customers, suppliers and the communities in which it operates, seeking to prevent or mitigate the direct or indirect adverse impacts of its activity. This statement is in line with the values and principles of action set out in CGD's Code of Conduct, namely those referring to compliance with legal, regulatory and conduct obligations, to the contribution to sustainable development and non-discrimination, tolerance and equal treatment.
In accordance with internal regulations, the approval of Policies/Service Orders is the responsibility of the Board of Directors / Executive Committee. The Board of Directors is the highest governance body.
CGD has several Policies that contribute to responsible business conduct, and the scope (business operations and relations) may vary depending on the areas in which these Policies | - | - | - | Principle 1 Companies need to support and respect the protecting of internationally recognised human rights
Principle 2 Ensure that they do not engage in human rights violations
Principle 4 Abolition of all kinds of forced or compulsory labour
Principle 5 Effective abolition of child labour

|   |  | operate. For example, the Environmental Policy applies to all activities, products and services of CGD in Portugal. One of its areas of activity is the integration of environmental criteria in the process of selecting suppliers and subcontractors, assuming the role of an agent of change in the value chain and collaborating to improve its customers' environmental performance.
The Code of Conduct should also be highlighted, as it enshrines the values, principles of action and rules of professional conduct observed in and by CGD in the exercise of its activity, and whose scope includes the commitment of the members of CGD's corporate bodies, its employees, trainees, service providers and agents, on a permanent or occasional basis. The commitment of service providers to the values, principles and rules of conduct within this Code is performed by written commitment as part of the contracting process.
Caixa is therefore committed to playing an active part in the transition towards a more sustainable future, influencing its stakeholders to adopt sustainability and responsible business principles. In this context, it is important to highlight the implementation of Ethical Principles and Good Business Practices in order to instil sustainability practices in its suppliers, covering topics such as the promotion of labour practices that respect human rights.
The Policies are accessible to all employees through the Internal Standards System and are available to external stakeholders through cgd.pt. |  |  |  | Principle 7 -
Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges |  |   |

|  2-24 | Embedding policy commitments | The sustainability management model is transversal to Caixa, the Sustainability Committee (CSU) standing out as the forum promoting the pursuit of sustainability policies and commitments and their respective integration into the organisational strategy and procedures. | - | - | - | - | SDG 16 - Peace, justice and strong institutions | C. Main risk factors  |

|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  The CSU is chaired by the Chief Executive Officer and includes in its composition the Chief Risk Officer and the Chief Sustainability Officer (both executive directors). This guarantees the existence of a robust, transparent management model that promotes the involvement of internal structural bodies in cross-cutting ESG projects and the respective continuous monitoring by the administration. |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |
|  In this context, it is important to highlight: |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |
|  a) The definition of 'Sustainability and Social Impact' as one of the areas of CGD's 2021-2024 strategic plan; |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |
|  b) The status assessment of the main commitments undertaken by CGD in matters of sustainability and the respective monitoring by the Sustainability Committee; |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |
|  c) The holding of internal sustainability audits. |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |
|  CGD also operates actively in its value chain, in particular with: |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |
|  a) The implementation of contractual mechanisms that aim to promote the adoption of good environmental practices in the supply chain, namely the Statement of Ethical Principles and Best Corporate Practices, which covers topics such as human rights or environmental preservation. |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |
|  b) The preparation of an ESG questionnaire for suppliers with 22 questions on Environmental, Social and Governance aspects. |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |
|  c) The implementation of an ESG Rating which makes it possible to assess and rank corporate customers in terms of sustainability, and may contribute to establishing of credit pricing. |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |
|  d) The publication of the CGD Principles for Sectoral Exclusion and Limitation, which acknowledge the existence of sectors of activity or projects that may contribute negatively towards sustainable development and therefore establishes a list of principles underpinning activities and projects that are excluded, or |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |

|   |  | restricted under certain conditions, from its credit policy.

# BRI 3. 2021 MATERIAL TOPICS

| 3-1 | Process to determine material topics | Developed in alignment with the Strategic Plan and as one of its six transformation pillars, the 2021 - 2024 Sustainability Strategy embodies Caixa's ambition to become the leader in sustainable financing in Portugal, supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy and funding projects with a social impact on people's lives. The 2021-2024 Sustainability Strategy is based on five strategic areas of action, which reflect the action for the nine material topics identified in the materiality analysis and which support the reporting structure of the 2022 Sustainability Report.

The management of business ethics is a vital tool in decision-making in the business context, since the vast majority of these decisions have, explicitly or implicitly, some ethical content. It is therefore necessary to have instruments that formalise and operationalise ethics management, and the Code of Conduct is particularly important in this context. Caixa makes its Code of Conduct available on its internal and external website.

|  206-1 | Legal actions for anti- competitive behavior, antitrust and monopoly practices | In September 2019, the Competition Authority ('AdC') imposed a fine of EUR 82,000,000.00 on Caixa. According to the AdC, between May 2002 and March 2013, several banks established in Portugal (including Caixa) participated in an exchange of sensitive information, in housing loans, consumer credit and corporate credit on (i) commercial conditions (prices/spread or intentions to change the respective prices/spreads which, according to the AdC, were not in the public | - | - | - | - | SDG 16 -

The AdC also considered that the shared information has a relevant, strategic and nonpublic nature, and that it is individual and broken-down information, which allows reducing the risk of competitive pressure and the uncertainty usually associated with the strategic behaviour of a competitor. Caixa judicially challenged the decision with the Competition, Regulation and Supervision Court on 22 October 2019. The judicial appeal is still pending.

In this context, Caixa promotes the implementation of measures and projects to manage and mitigate the significant impacts of the waste generated by its activity: <br> Upstream: When signing a contract with Caixa, suppliers contractually adhere to the Declaration of Ethical Principles and Best Business Practices, which outlines conduct requirements related to sustainability and is an important mechanism for mitigating environmental risks in the supply chain. Caixa also makes quarterly visits to suppliers located at its head office building, with the aim of identifying opportunities for improvement and reducing the environmental risk associated with its subcontracted activities. <br> Downstream: Downstream, Caixa highlights initiatives designed to reduce waste, waste generation and the environmental footprint, namely 1) the Card Recycling Programme, which promotes the circular economy by collecting and sending bank cards for recycling, transforming the resulting PVC waste into 100\% recycled plastic urban furniture items delivered to charitable institutions and 2) the Goods Donation Programme, which promotes the reuse of discontinued equipment and materials, in favour of local institutions and communities that will give them new usefulness and value. <br> Scope: Caixa |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |

# Annex C - Methodological Notes 

## 204-1

Caixa made a change to the methodology adopted in previous years, in which the calculation only considered suppliers of goods and services with annual invoicing to CGD of $€ 2,500$ or more (with nondeductible VAT). In 2022, for the calculation of the percentage of expenses with suppliers, all suppliers of goods and services with total annual invoicing to CGD were considered (with VAT whenever applicable and without deducting the pro-rata).

## 302-1/305-1

Stationary combustion (combustion in stationary equipment - i.e. non-mobile equipment, such as boilers, furnaces or gas heaters)

The collection of information from CGD (Portugal) and Affiliated Banks is carried out according to the following parameters:

- Portugal: consumption of natural gas, for heating purposes, and diesel, to run the emergency generators;
- BI, BCA, BCI, BCGA, Timor Branch and BNU Macau: consumption of diesel by infrastructures/generators;
- France Branch: No fuel is consumed in its infrastructures.

After quantifying the above consumptions, the conversion factors shown in the table below are applied for each year:

Table 1- Conversion factors for natural gas, diesel and petrol.

# Mobile combustion (non-electric means of transport owned by the organisation) 

With regard to Caixa's fleet in Portugal, the figures include fuel consumption by its own fleet (Galp cards) and by other vehicles used by the company, whose expenses are reimbursed upon presentation of an invoice. In this latter case, in 2021, the figure for litres consumed was calculated using the average price per litre of the fuel that was used:

|  |  | CGD |  |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
|  |  | 2022 | Source |
| Regular Diesel | €/litre | 1.796 |  |

| GPL Auto | €/litre | 0.896 | medio-diario/\#download(DGEG) |

CGD's fleet is made up of hybrid and electric vehicles. As electricity is consumed from the chargers at Caixa's head office building, this consumption falls under electricity consumption.
Timor Branch: The figures for the fuel consumed by the company's vehicles is calculated via the computerisation of filling station invoices.
BCA, France Branch and BNU Macau: The consumption figures are the litres of fuel used by each vehicle. BI: The figures for fuel consumption are calculated based on the average price per kilometre of each vehicle.

BCGA: the figures for fuel consumption in litres are estimated considering accounting movements, assuming that $74 \%$ of the travel costs are associated with petrol vehicles and $26 \%$ are associated with diesel vehicles.
Energy consumptions within the organisation were converted into energy units (GJ) according to Table 1. The following table reports the emission factors that were used:

Fugitive emissions (due to gas leaking from refrigeration equipment, air conditioners, fire extinguishers, sulphur hexafluoride or nitrogen trifluoride)

In the case of F-gas leaks, the global warming potential of the gas was considered. At Caixa (Portugal), leaks from air conditioning systems in central buildings and the branch office network are included (extinguishing equipment is excluded). BI, BCGA, BCI, the Timor Branch and the France Branch do not have standardised methods for compiling this information.

# 305-2 

EDP Comercial was Caixa's electricity supplier (mainland Portugal) until June 2022; as of that date, 83.7\% of the energy supply was assured by Endesa and $16.3 \%$ by Serviço Universal. In the Azores Autonomous Region, electricity was supplied by Eletricidade dos Açores (EDA), and in the Madeira Autonomous Region, it was supplied by Empresa de Eletricidade da Madeira (EEM).

The figures shown do not reflect the losses associated with the distribution and transport of electricity in the grid, as well as the losses inherent to limitations of efficiency associated with the production processes that are at the origin of the electricity consumed.

The following table presents the emission factors used to perform the conversion of associated emissions:

Affiliated Banks BI, BCA, BCGA, BCI, Mozambique and Timor do not have mechanisms that allow calculating emissions using the market-based method.

The Caixa Group calculates scope-3 emissions related to the following categories:

1. Category 6, work-related trips by plane, train and boat in third-party vehicles at the CGD Group.
2. Category 5, ex-situ treatment of waste produced at Caixa (Portugal).
3. Category 15, the financing portfolio at Caixa (Portugal).

# Category 6: work-related trips by plane, train, boat and in third-party vehicles 

In terms of work-related trips, the emissions associated with transport by plane, train, boat and individual transport (in third-party vehicles) are considered in accordance with each Bank's reality:

Regarding data processing, there are specificities related to the mode of travel:

- Air travel - flights are subdivided by destinations and number of stopovers (categorising them as domestic, short and long haul), taking into account, where available, their origin and destination. The airline distance provided by https://pt.distance.to/ was used to calculate the kilometres travelled on airplane trips. The emission factor used considered the RF (Radiative Forcing).
- Train - Calculated based on accounting movements and origin-destination pairs according to the standard cost of journeys between major stations. Where destination data were unavailable, a proxy was performed using the average price per kilometre of these trips and the distance travelled was estimated taking into account the amount paid and the average price per kilometre for each place of origin. With regard to BCGA, a proxie was made of the kilometers traveled per employee in this type of work-related trips taking into account the data for Portugal.
- Individual transport -Calculated based on the accounting movements recorded in the system; an average conversion factor is applied to estimate the kilometres travelled.
In calculating kilometres for work-related travelling (plane, boat, train), whenever the trip's start and end was the same, only the outward trip was considered. Otherwise, it was accounted for as a round trip.

The emission factors below were applied to the distances travelled:

## 2. Category 15: Financing Portfolio

Scope: CGD, S.A (Portugal)
Caixa calculated emissions from investments in the categories of business loans (loan portfolio), project finance (electricity generation projects), residential mortgages ("mortgages") and commercial mortgages ("real estate") according to PCAF guidelines.

## Financing to companies

## - Business Loans

Issues of Caixa's credit portfolio were calculated in accordance with the PCAF methodology for the "business loans" category and in accordance with the following options:

| PCAF option | Formula | PCAF <br> score |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 1a | $\sum_{\text {outstanding amount }_{c}}$ <br> Total equity + debt $_{c} \times$ Verified company emissions $_{c}$ | 1 |
| 2a | $\sum_{\text {outstanding amount }_{c}}$ <br> Total equity + debt $_{c} \times$ Unverified company emissions $_{c}$ | 2 |
| 3a | $\sum_{\text {outstanding amount }_{c}}$ <br> Total equity + debt $_{c} \times$ Revenue $_{c} \times \frac{\text { GHG emissions }_{c}}{\text { Revenue }_{c}}$ | 4 |
| 3b | $\sum_{\text {outstanding amount }_{c}} \times \frac{\text { GHG emissions }_{c}}{\text { Assets }_{c}}$ | 5 |

Data used in the calculation: i) The "outstanding amount" corresponds to the outstanding value of each counterparty (excluding off-balance amounts); ii) Equity, debt and revenues data of each counterparty at 31-Dec-2021 were used (internal bank data, whenever available); iii) The sector emission factors used (for Scores 4 and 5) were calculated based on the most recent information available on the INE, Pordata, Eurostat and DGEG websites. A national average value for emissions associated with the Portuguese electricity generation sector provided by the International Energy Agency (IEA) for Portugal (gCO2/kWh) was also used; iv) For the calculation of Score 1 and 2 emissions, public information of the counterparts with emissions data disclosure (relative to the year 2021) was consulted.

# - Project Finance - Electricity Generation 

Emissions from electricity-generation projects in project finance were calculated according to the PCAF methodology relative to this category and according to the option below:

| PCAF option | Formula | PCAF <br> score |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 2 b | $\sum_{p} \frac{\text { Outstanding amount }_{p}}{\text { Total equity }+ \text { debt }_{p}} \times \text { Producion }_{p} \times \text { Emission factor }$ | 3 |

Data used in the calculation: i) Bank's internal data regarding electricity generation projects (outstanding amounts (€), total equity+dept (€) and production in 2022 (MWh)); ii) Emission factors made available by ERSE per generation technology.

## - Commercial Mortgages

Data used: i) outstanding amounts (€), appraised value (€) and energy certificate level of the properties (internal data from the Bank); ii) Emission factors per $\mathrm{m}^{2}\left(\mathrm{tCO}_{2} / \mathrm{m}^{2}\right)$ or per property ( $\mathrm{tCO}_{2} /$ property) extracted from the PCAF "European building emission factor database" according to energy certificate level and property typology.

## 401-1

The formulas used to calculate turnover rates and new hires for Caixa and Affiliated Banks were the following:

- Turnover rate $=$ (No. of employees leaving during the reporting period / total No. of employees at the end of the reporting period) $\times 100$, by age group and gender
- Rate of new hirings $=$ (No. of new hirings / total no. of employees) $\times 100$, by age group and gender

As far as Caixa is concerned, the figures shown only include employees in permanent service at CGD, S.A. and those on secondment (placed in CGD's Divisions). As of 2021, the merger of Caixa Leasing e Factoring into Caixa Geral de Depósitos is also considered, with a direct impact on the number of hirings and exits (employees who, prior to the merger, had already been transferred to CGD, SA on secondment).

# 401-3 

The formulas used to calculate the return and retention rates for Caixa and Affiliated Banks were the following:

- Rate of return to work = (Total number of employees returning to work following maternity or paternity leave / Total number of employees benefiting from maternity or paternity leave) * 100, by gender
- Retention rate $=$ (Total number of employees retained 12 months after returning to work following maternity or paternity leave / Total number of employees returning from maternity or paternity leave during the preceding reporting period) *100, by gender.


## 404-1

This indicator was calculated using the following formula for Caixa and for Affiliated Banks:

- Average number of hours of training by professional category $=$ Total number of hours of training by professional category/ Total number of employees in each category.
- Average number of hours of training by gender $=$ Total number of hours of training by gender / Total number of employees of each gender.


## 405-2

The average base salary, by gender and professional category, was calculated, considering the base salaries of employees. The ratio was obtained by dividing the average base salary of women in each professional category by the average base salary of men in the corresponding professional categories.

The difference between the average base salary and the average remuneration is that the latter considers the base salary plus employee benefits.

## 417-2

Non-compliances with regulations and voluntary codes related to information and labelling of products/services included non-compliances that resulted in warnings or fines imposed by supervisory bodies or judicial authorities, relating to the provision of mandatory pre-contractual and contractual information in the marketing of products and services, relating to mandatory information on special arrangements and related to the information made available to the public in the price list.

## 417-3

Non-compliances with voluntary codes and regulations related to marketing communications, including advertising, promotion and sponsorship, included non-compliances that resulted in warnings or fines imposed by supervisory bodies or judicial authorities, relating to information duties in advertising and marketing communications, as set out in legislation, in regulations issued by supervisory bodies, internal regulations, Caixa's Code of Conduct and other voluntary codes of conduct, namely those of the Portuguese Association of Advertisers (APAN) and the Civil Institute for Advertising Self-Regulation (ICAP).

# Annex D - Response to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 

## Disclosure of financial information on climate as per TCFD guidelines

In 2015, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) established the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), a working group with the aim of developing a set of reporting recommendations to clearly and consistently disclose information that helps financial markets understand climate change-related risks and impacts.

In its 2022 Sustainability Report, Caixa has, for the third consecutive year, developed a comprehensive approach to the baseline recommendations of the TCFD, thereby promoting the disclosure of comparable, reliable and clear climate information to its various stakeholders. Caixa has been monitoring the most recent TCFD reporting recommendations, namely those concerning the disclosure of scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, taking into account the materiality of this topic for the financial sector.

Caixa Group believes that disclosing information in line with the best reporting practices will enable stakeholders to understand the financial implications associated with climate change and to strive to enforce mitigation and adaptation measures, helping to promote investment in sustainable and resilient solutions, opportunities and business models.

## Summary of recommendations

This entity has developed a multi-sectorial reporting framework supported by four theme-based areas that represent key components for companies to operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.

# Governance 

Fully owned by the Portuguese State, Caixa is a credit institution whose mission is to create value for the Portuguese society by providing quality banking services to individuals and companies, thereby contributing to promoting sustainable finance in Portugal and to the transition to a carbon-neutral economy by 2050.

Caixa Group has direct and indirect holdings in several domestic and international companies operating in sectors as diverse as commercial banking, investment banking, venture capital, asset management, specialised credit, and the real estate market. Its organisational and management model combines this mission with the objective of profitability, growth and financial strengthening, prudent risk management, good relations with stakeholders, and a strategic commitment to sustainable development.

Sustainability and social impact is one of the six pillars of the 21-24 Strategic Plan outlined by Caixa's Board of Directors. This pillar is supported by an ambitious action plan that incorporates a series of actions and KPIs in relevant areas for developing a more responsible, resilient and inclusive business model, such as climate risk management.

## Governance model for climate-related risks and opportunities

In 2022, Caixa updated the powers, operating rules, composition and respective support structure of the Sustainability Committee, seeking to specify the governance model related to the management of climate and environmental risks (RC\&A), namely through the implementation of measures for the mitigation and adaptation of RC\&A, the fostering of strategies to integrate the results of climate stress tests and scenario assessments into the Group's business strategy and the monitoring of action plans in response to the requirements of the regulator and of the supervisor.

The governance model for risks and opportunities inherent to climate and environmental risk cuts across the entire organisation and encompasses the participation of several Caixa Group divisions and companies. However, the Risk Management Division (DGR) and the Corporate Support Division (DSC) play a key role in enforcing the Board of Directors' supervision in terms of governance of climate-related risks and opportunities.

As of 2022, the Sustainability Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, also includes the Chief Risk Officer and the Chief Sustainability Officer (both executive directors). This guarantees the existence of a robust and transparent management model that promotes the development of cross-cutting ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) projects and the respective continuous monitoring by the administration.

Corporate Support
Division (DSC)

The Corporate Support Division provides corporate advice and support to Caixa's governing bodies in carrying out their duties and fulfilling the responsibilities assigned to them by the Shareholder. It includes the Sustainability area, which is responsible for outlining, promoting and monitoring the Corporate Sustainability Strategy and ensuring compliance with the Principles of the United Nations Global Compact and alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals, coordinating the Corporate Sustainability Programme and the Environmental Management System, taking into account economic, social and environmental intervention values.

# Strategy 

The Shareholder envisions Caixa as a benchmark institution in the financial system and as the leader of the Portuguese banking sector, continuously striving to improve its competitive advantage and to ensure more robustness, profitability, services and efficiency in line with the best practices of the European banking sector.

Caixa recognises that the adoption of sustainable development practices in the bank's day-to-day management is an integral part of its mission and is committed to:

- Integrating environmental criteria as determining factors for creating value and the sustainability of the business, supporting and strengthening its corporate strategy, brand and values;
- Being responsible for preserving the environment, managing and monitoring the direct and indirect impacts of its activities, products and services;
- The promotion and participation of stakeholders, taking into account their expectations and values in decision-making and strategy.

The Caixa Group believes that, by incorporating climate-related risks and opportunities into risk management and strategic planning processes, it will be better able to understand the financial implications associated with climate change as well as leverage mitigation and adaptation to climate change, strengthening the organisation and its customers, and directing investment towards sustainable and resilient solutions, opportunities and business models.

## Sustainability Strategy

In order to guarantee the implementation of Caixa's Sustainability Strategy, a management model was implemented across the organisation as a whole, including the Caixa Group divisions and companies regarded as the most relevant to meet the proposed sustainability goals.

Caixa's 2021-2024 Strategic Plan defines "Sustainability and Social Impact" as one of the action vectors in pursuing a profitable and sustainable business model. In this sense, the bank has established its 2021-2024 Sustainability Strategy and respective strategic pillars through a holistic approach that materialises the ambition to become a leader in sustainable finance in Portugal, supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy and financing projects with a social impact on people's lives:

1) Sustainable and Inclusive Finance- Financing the transition to a low-carbon economy in a fair and inclusive way.
2) Climate Risk Management - Accelerating the transition to a more sustainable and resilient economy by efficiently managing climate risks.
3) Equity, Digital and Financial Inclusion - Being an inclusive bank that prioritises the well-being and development of employees and society.
4) Transparent Governance Models - Adopting efficient governance models that drive performance in a responsible, diverse, and transparent manner.
5) Disclosure of Sustainability Information - Making regular and transparent disclosures on ESG performance in accordance with best reporting practice and applicable regulations.

The Sustainability Strategy is reflected on an annual action plan that incorporates the challenges and commitments voluntarily undertaken by Caixa, in particular:
$>$ Net-Zero Banking Alliance
$>$ Principles for Responsible Banking
$>$ Principles for Responsible Investment
$>$ Business Ambition for $1.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
$>10$ Principles of the UN Global Compact
In 2021, Caixa joined the Net Zero Banking Alliance - NZBA - joining banking institutions from different countries that are committed to implementing strategies and business models that allow for the achievement of carbon neutrality (Net Zero) by 2050.

NZBA member commitments include:

- Aligning greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the financing and investment portfolio with the necessary path to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050;
- Prioritising efforts in the most impact-heavy sectors, that is, the most intensive and GHG emitting sectors, which is key to the transition to a carbon-neutral economy;
- Setting immediate targets for 2030, prioritising emission-intensive sectors;
- Using decarbonisation scenarios from recognised sources and maximising alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals.

In addition, in 2022, Caixa Gestão de Ativos (CXA) joined the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative (NZAM), a global initiative bringing together the efforts and commitment of signatory international asset management companies to decarbonise their portfolios under management, thereby contributing to the target of reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. As part of joining NZAM, members undertake to:

- Working in partnership with asset-owning clients on decarbonisation goals, consistent with the ambition to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 or earlier in all assets under management (AuM);
- Setting an intermediate target for the proportion of assets to be managed in order to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 or earlier;
- Reviewing the intermediate target at least every five years, with a view to increasing the proportion of AuM covered until $100 \%$ of assets are included.

So as to meet its commitments and the Paris Agreement goal of 'limiting the increase in the global average temperature to well below $2^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to $1.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ above pre-industrial levels', Caixa has implemented the following projects and policies:

# Climate change as a material and emerging risk 

As a priority of its business strategy, the Caixa Group has set forth the strengthening of non-financial risks control, whose main responsibilities include identifying, assessing, measuring, monitoring, control and reporting the Group's non-financial risks, which include the dimensions of emerging risks intrinsically related to sustainability, as well as a specific risk subcategory concerning the impact of climate change in the context of banking activity.

The management of non-financial risks and, in particular, challenges related to sustainability, is becoming increasingly relevant for Caixa Group. Its concern with the risks underlying sustainability is intended to be increasingly relevant and effectively make a difference in the decision-making process.

In accordance with the Group's risk taxonomy, climate-related and environmental risks are a subcategory of business and strategy risk and also an additional risk factor for the other prudential risk categories, namely credit risk, market risk, operational risk and reputational risk. Caixa considers that these risks comprise two fundamental risk drivers:

- Physical risk: refers to the financial impact of changing climate, including more frequent extreme weather events and gradual changes in climate, as well as of environmental degradation, such as air, water and land pollution, water stress, biodiversity loss and deforestation. Physical risk is therefore categorised as "acute" when it arises from extreme events, such as droughts, floods and storms, and as "chronic" when it arises from progressive shifts, such as increasing temperatures, sea-levels rises, water stress, biodiversity loss, land use change, habitat destruction, and resource scarcity. This can directly result in, for example, damage to property or reduced productivity, or indirectly lead to subsequent events, such as disruption of supply chains.
- Transition risk: refers to an institution's financial losses that can result, directly or indirectly, from the adjustment process towards a low-carbon and more environmentally sustainable economy. This could be triggered, for example, by a relatively abrupt adoption of climate and environmental policies, technological progress or changes in market sentiment and preferences.

Caixa has been developing capacity for identifying, assessing, monitoring, mitigating and reporting climaterelated and environmental risks. This will make it possible to improve the adaptation and resilience of its business model to the potential impact and magnitude of these risks. A forward-looking and long-term approach is particularly important given the uncertainty regarding the timeframe for the expression of these risks, which appears to be longer term, however depending on short-term action on climate change adaptation and mitigation.

# Double materiality approach 

Caixa's approach to climate change includes a 'double materiality' perspective, taking into account both the impact of climate on Caixa's activity and Caixa's impact on the environment.

| Financial materiality <br> (Risk of negative impact on the company) |  |
| :--: | :--: |
| Transition risks | Physical Risks |
| Risks for the company arising from the transition to a lowcarbon, climate-resilient economy: <br> Regulatory risks <br> Legal risks <br> $\checkmark$ <br> $\checkmark$ <br> $\checkmark$ <br> $\checkmark$ <br> $\checkmark$ <br> $\checkmark$ <br> $\checkmark$ <br> $\checkmark$ <br> $\checkmark$ <br> $\checkmark$ <br> $\checkmark$ <br> $\checkmark$ <br> $\checkmark$ <br> $\checkmark$ <br> $\checkmark$ <br> $\checkmark$ <br> $\checkmark$ <br> $\checkmark$ <br> $\checkmark$ <br> $\checkmark$ <br> $\checkmark$ <br> $\checkmark$ <br> $\checkmark$ <br> $\checkmark$ <br> $\checkmark$ <br> $\checkmark$ <br> $\checkmark$ <br> |

Environmental and social materiality (Risk of negative impact on the climate)

Arise from the institution's own operations and may occur throughout the value chain.

Main focus is on GHG emissions, which comprehends three scopes:

Scope 1 : Direct GHG emissions from sources owned or controlled by the organisation;

Scope 2 : Direct GHG emissions from electrical energy purchased by the organisation;

Scope 3: Other indirect emissions that result from activities not owned or controlled by the company but which have an indirect impact throughout the value chain.

For a financial institution, scope 3 category 15 emissions (investments) most often represent the most significant part of its GHG emissions inventory, meaning that they are crucial for managing risks and opportunities associated with climate change and also for setting emission reduction goals and business strategy.

Climate-related risks fall into two main categories: risks inherent to the transition to a low-carbon economy ('transition risks') and risks inherent to the physical impacts of climate change ('physical risks').

The transition to a low-carbon economy may entail wide-ranging political, legal, technological and market changes to meet climate change-related mitigation and adaptation requirements. Depending on the nature, speed and incidence of these changes, transition risks may represent various levels of financial and reputational risks for Caixa.

Physical risks resulting from specific weather events (acute) or resulting from long-term climate change (chronic) may have financial implications for Caixa, such as direct damage to assets and indirect impacts on operations and business continuity.

Financial performance can also be affected by changes in the availability, supply and quality of water, food safety and extreme temperature changes, which affect organisations' facilities, operations, supply chain, transport needs, and employee safety.

A strong growth of market dynamics is expected, anchored in various public policies in order to ensure the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 undertaken by Portugal. The magnitude and distribution of physical and transition risks depend on the swiftness of implementation of mitigation measures and the degree of organisation of the transition.

Notes:

1. The categorisation of the time horizon is as follows: Short term (0-2 years), medium term (2-5 years) and long term (> 5 years).

# Climate-related opportunities 

Climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts also generate opportunities for Caixa, such as:

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), in order to meet global emissions reduction targets, countries will need to transition a significant percentage of their power generation to low-emission alternatives, such as wind, solar, wave, tidal, hydro, geothermal or nuclear energy, energy from biofuels, as well as carbon capture and storage.

Caixa is aware of the opportunity associated with the use of new technologies and low-emission energy sources. Caixa has been investing in the production of renewable energy and implementing various energy efficiency measures in its corporate buildings and branch office network.

Its main projects in this field are as follows:

- The solar thermal power plant at the Head Office Building: collectors installed on the head office's $1,600 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ roof generate energy for heating and cooling water required for centralised air conditioning and sanitary facilities (3,557 GJ generated in 2022).
- Solar photovoltaic microgeneration in the branch network: installation of solar photovoltaic panels (544 GJ generated in 2022).

According to the 2050 Roadmap for Carbon Neutrality, the global aggregate value of investment required in Portugal to achieve carbon neutrality is estimated at $€ 1,017$ billion.

As a benchmark institution in the financial sector, one of Caixa's priorities is to support the transition to a low-carbon economy through its financing and investment activities. Caixa recognises the opportunity associated with the development of sustainable products and services that can potentially contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in its financing portfolio.

An example is Leasing for hybrid and electric vehicles, a financing line that aims to support investment in hybrid and electric vehicles, financing the transition to a more sustainable mobility model. A total of $€ 51.4$ million was funded in 2022, corresponding to an increase of $43 \%$ compared to 2021.

The fact that investors are increasingly focused on the transformation to a net-zero economy is increasingly being reflected in the bond market. According to data released by S\&P Global, the global issue of green, social, sustainable and sustainability-linked bonds is expected to reach from USD 900 million to 1 trillion by 2023.

Caixa monitors trends and opportunities generated by new markets and agents of change, integrating different aspects into its portfolio and providing financial offers that make it easier to access environmentally responsible products with less environmental impact.

In 2022, Caixa continued to issue sustainable debt bonds, having successfully completed two green senior preferred debt issues, amounting to $€ 800$ million, totalling $€ 1.3$ billion in instruments of this typology. These are the first issues made by a Portuguese bank with these characteristics (green) and it is an important milestone in fulfilling the commitments undertaken by Caixa Geral de Depósitos in the field of sustainable finance.

Caixa is a benchmark in the Portuguese financial sector and is recognised for its contribution to promoting savings, financing the economy, strengthening competitiveness, innovation and the internationalisation of Portuguese companies.

Caixa plays an active role in the transparent disclosure of climate-related information and in raising its stakeholders' awareness of environmental issues, thereby helping to increase its reputation and brand value.

Aiming to provide the most transparency to its stakeholders and in order to manage its reputational risks, Caixa has been voluntarily participating in the assessment of various sustainability indices, such as the Carbon Disclosure Project, and requesting audits by an external entity of the information contained in its sustainability report.

In 2022, Caixa was distinguished as the Best Bank in Sustainability, in the context of Banking in Portugal, by Scopen's Brandscore study, which is the result of spontaneous naming by customers and non-customers.

# Scenario analysis and stress testing 

A sustainable European future is a priority and the financial sector plays a key role in delivering an ambitious and comprehensive package of measures to ensure Europe's climate neutrality by 2050. In this context, Caixa is developing a set of forward-looking tools with the aim of better understanding its vulnerabilities, main risks and opportunities, as well as its climate change challenges.

In outlining its business strategy, where climate-related and environmental risks are integrated, sensitivity analyses and short-, medium- and long-term scenarios are perceived as a particularly useful tool in identifying limitations, vulnerabilities and deficiencies in a future that is still extremely uncertain with potential transition paths that are significantly different.

Thus, already integrating climate-related and environmental risks into its stress-testing framework, Caixa is developing and strengthening a set of quantification methodologies that allow it to test the resilience of its business model, taking into account the sensitivity of portfolios, sectors and geographic locations vulnerable to climate factors.

With this goal in mind, Caixa began with carrying out several risk assessments, both for transition risk and physical risk, for different portfolios, sectors and geographic areas. Initially based on a series of qualitative assumptions, these sensitivity analyses and scenarios allowed those assumptions to be strengthened with more quantitative data and methodologies.

Although at CGD climate and environmental risks are a subcategory of strategy and business risk, CGD has designed its risk profile from a forward-looking and cross-cutting perspective that allows the assessment of the impacts of physical and transition risk on its main risk drivers. Thus, taking into account its risk profile, CGD considered the impacts of climate-related and environmental risks on credit risk and operational risk when assessing its capital adequacy from an economic and regulatory perspective.

In addition, scenario analyses are being used to capture and test the impacts of climate-related risks in the short, medium and long term, for different transition scenarios with regard to the physical and transition risk dimensions. For this purpose, the basis of the scenarios that have been considered are the climate scenarios developed by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). For the long term, three NGFS scenarios, with different environmental policy ambitions and technology changes, were considered: Net Zero 2050 (1.54C), Delayed Transition ( $<2^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) and Current Policies ( $3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}+$ ). For the short term, two scenarios were considered: the Delayed Transition scenario ( $<2^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) and the budget baseline scenario, supplemented with climate factors. Additionally, CGD considers a single climate event scenario to assess the impacts of acute physical events.

This assessment has mostly focused on households and companies. In the case of exposure to companies, for each sector, there are two main goals: determining the impact of physical risk events on the supply chain, activity disruption, productivity decline or physical asset devaluation, and determining the impact of the

carbon transition on investment in low-carbon technologies, changes in market sentiment, and direct and indirect costs. In loans to households, for the time being, the climate stress testing methodology focuses on mortgage loans, as this is the segment with the greatest weight in the household loan portfolio. In this case, the aim is to use the location of the collateral to determine exposure to each physical risk event and to use the energy label classification to assess exposure to transition risks. Both physical and transition risks are expected to decrease the value of real estate assets, having an impact on credit risk via an increase in Loss Given Default (LGD).

Therefore, these scenario and sensitivity analyses are expected to include an assessment of the climaterelated and environmental risks to which the institution is exposed in its current activity-planning horizon, as well as an assessment in the long run, beyond the typical activity-planning horizon.

With this is mind, and aware of the importance of these risks in the short and long term, CGD is working towards integrating the results of sensitivity assessments and scenario analyses to outline and implement its business model. This integrated vision allows not only the identification of continuous risk mitigation actions and the strengthening of its capacities and monitoring tools, but also the identification of a set of opportunities for this new goal.

All this will allow not only to strengthen the resilience of CGD's business model in the short, medium and long term and prepare the Group set of unpredictable but increasingly plausible risks, but also to seize the opportunities that will arise from a future increased awareness for climate change.

# Alignment of the portfolio and carbon footprint at Caixa 

The accounting of GHG emissions and their periodic monitoring are vital practices for building an effective strategy for managing and reducing GHG emissions. Caixa prepares an annual GHG emissions inventory in accordance with the guidelines of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol), including emissions from three types of scopes:

- Scope 1: Direct emissions stemming from fuel consumption in buildings; Direct emissions stemming from fuel consumption by the Caixa fleet; Direct emissions resulting from F-gas leaks in equipment installed in Caixa's facilities.
- Scope 2: Indirect emissions resulting from electricity consumption.
- Scope 3: Indirect emissions, resulting from business travel (air, train, boat, and individual transport), treatment of waste produced on the facilities, and financing portfolio.

For a financial institution, category 15 emissions (investments) often represent the most significant part of its GHG emissions inventory, so their accounting is crucial for assessing risks and opportunities associated with climate change, and also for setting its emission reduction goals and business strategy.

The calculation of scope 3 emissions (category 15) was carried out in line with the guidelines of the 'Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials' (PCAF) standard, a collaborative initiative aimed at developing methodologies for calculating and reporting emissions associated with loans and investments of financial institutions for different asset classes (namely loans to corporates, mortgage loans, commercial mortgages, project finance). This standard was developed based on the GHG Protocol guidelines and is recognised by SBTi in the 'Financial Sector Science-Based Targets Guidance'.

The figure below shows the results of the carbon footprint for 2022:
![img-174.jpeg](img-174.jpeg)

# Calculation of emissions associated with corporate financing: 

This calculation was carried out in accordance with the PCAF methodological approach, which accounts for the (actual or estimated) emissions of the bank's counterparties and an allocation factor (which assesses what percentage of the counterparty's emissions are attributed to the bank).

Actual emission data reported by counterparties were retrieved from public sources (namely the sustainability report) for the 2021 financial year.

To estimate counterparty emissions (where unavailable), a sectorial emission factor was calculated (based on public sector data) which estimates scope 1 and 2 emissions by sector (ratio of $\mathrm{tCO}_{2} / \mathrm{M} €$ of sector assets or $\mathrm{tCO}_{2} / \mathrm{M} €$ of sector revenues).

The calculation of emissions associated with project finance - electricity generation - was carried out considering the production data of each project and the corresponding emission factors.

## Calculation of emissions associated with commercial and residential mortgages:

The calculation of emissions associated with financing for commercial mortgages and residential mortgages was performed based on emission factors made available by PCAF for each property typology (PCAF European Building emission factor database) and took into account the energy certificate level of each property and the properties' area.

To learn more about the calculation methodologies, please refer to annex C to the 2022 Sustainability Report.

# Risk Management 

The Chief Risk Officer (CRO), who is a member of the Executive Committee, is ultimately responsible for the CGD Group's risk management function. The CRO of Caixa is globally responsible for monitoring the Group's risk management and partcularly for ensuring the adequate and effective operationof the risk management function. The CRO also has the dutty to inform and clarify the members of management and supervisory bodies on the risks incurred, on CGD and CGD Group's global risk profile and on the degree of compliance with the defined risk tolerance levels.

Risk management is centralised and supported by a dedicated structure - the Risk Management Division (DGR) -, under the responsibility of the CRO.

The Non-Financial Risks Area of the Risk Management Division, created in 2019, is responsible for identifying, assessing, monitoring, control and reporting the climate-related and environmental risks to which CGD Group is exposed and for the interrelationships with other existing risk categories, with a view to ensuring that climate-related and environmental risks remain within the risk appetite level established by the Board of Directors.

Additionally, this area contributes towards outlining the strategy and implementing risk management policies and procedures, continuously ensuring compliance and conformity with the supervisor's guidelines and legal and regulatory requirements in this field.

This area also aims to outline the strategy and subsequent risk management model, within a framework of coordinated intervention between the three lines of defence, and develop a specific management model for climate-related and environmental risks, with its own tools and methodologies that include, among others, outlining and monitoring a series of risk indicators.

## Risk management framework

Climate-related and environmental risks are integrated into CGD Group's risk management framework and, therefore, integrates the bank's risk appetite, decision-making processes and strategy. They are currently a subcategory of business and strategy risk and also an additional risk factor for other traditional risk categories: credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, reputational risk and compliance risk.
![img-175.jpeg](img-175.jpeg)

According to CGD Group's risk taxonomy, non-financial risks include four key risks (besides the traditional operational risk), namely: strategy and business, model, information technology, and reputational.

Business and strategy risk is the risk of losses arising from macroeconomic, geopolitical, positioning and business model strategy, investments made, holdings in banks and other types of institutions, climate-related and environmental risks, and pandemics.

Climate-related and environmental risk is the risk of negative impacts on results or capital arising from climate change and environmental degradation that affect systems (natural and human) and regions, being sources of structural changes that affect economic activity. Climate-related and environmental risks are commonly considered to comprise two main risk drivers - transition risk and physical risk.

A specific management model for these risks has been implemented, which comprehend the identification, assessment, measurement, monitoring, control and reporting of non-financial risks (complementing the area specialised in 'traditional operational' risks) throughout CGD Group.

The climate-related and environmental risk management framework also aims to mitigate other relevant negative impacts, namely in terms of sustainable finance, compliance with regulatory requirements and achieving strategic goals for sustainability and carbon neutrality.

The principles and responsibilities applicable to the management of these risks are set forth in the Corporate Policy for Non-Financial Risks.

The availability and quality of climate data has been a challenge for the organisation. Caixa created a dedicated working group to address the governance and management of climate data, which meets on a regular basis and brings together different areas, namely commercial areas, sustainability and others with risk management responsibilities. Caixa aims to ensure that there is an effective and holistic data aggregation and capability. As the availability and quality of data evolves, the organisation will improve the accuracy and estimates of climate data, constantly maintaining transparency regarding the limitations of data supporting analyses and reporting.

# Risk identification and assessment 

CGD Group has implemented a process to identify the Group's risk profile, which is carried out in annual cycles and is based on the CGD Group's risk taxonomy, in order to assess and inventory risks that are of concern. The process is structured in two stages, the first consists of a risk self-assessment carried out by CGD and CGD Group entities, while the second phase consists of determining CGD Group's risk profile based on the results of the self-assessment by all the entities that participate in the process.

This process relies on the broad involvement of different areas of the bank (including the first line of defence, the Compliance Division for compliance risk and the Risk Management Division for all other risks) and culminates with CGD Group's risk profile and the identification of risks subject to quantification under the internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP).

The result of the assessment is then submitted to CGD's Board of Directors.
Identifying the risk profile is crucial not only insofar as it enables conclusions to be drawn about the risks to which Caixa is exposed, thus enabling more informed decision-making within the risk management framework, namely in essential pillars such as the ICAAP, the risk appetite framework, internal stress-testing exercises, and the outlining of corporate strategy.

According to the assessment carried out in 2022, climate-related and environmental risks were considered material and emerging for the CGD Group.

Although climate-related and environmental risk is a stand-alone risk category for CGD Group, Caixa recognises that this risk may also have an impact on the Group's risk profile through other existing risk categories. Therefore, an assessment was performed on the materiality of the impact of the different risk drivers associated with climate change on the remaining risks categories.

The level of sensitivity to transition risk is estimated based on a qualitative analysis of the estimated exposure of a given risk category to regulatory, technology, market and reputational changes caused by decarbonisation, and the impact of those effects over a given time horizon.

The level of sensitivity to physical risk is estimated based on a qualitative analysis of the estimated exposure of a given risk category to chronic and acute weather events and the impact of those effects over a given time horizon.

Caixa intends to improve, in 2023, the use of quantitative data for carrying out this exercise.

The results of CGD's self-assessment for each risk category were as follows:

|  | Transition risk |  |  | Physical risk |  |  |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
|  | Short Term | Medium <br> Term | Long Term | Short Term | Medium <br> Term | Long Term |
| Credit risk |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Market Risk |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Operational Risk |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Liquidity risk |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Reputational risk |  |  |  |  |  |  |


|  | Low risk | Moderate risk | High risk |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |

It should be noted that the risk assessment presented in the table above reflects the level of risk from a forward-looking perspective.

# I. Transition Risk 

In order to identify and assess transition risk, Caixa identified the sectors and segments most vulnerable to transition risk, using a heatmap approach. The heatmap was then mapped with the exposure of the portfolio to analyse the way materiality and transition risk intersect.

This methodology makes it possible to identify exposure concentrations in assets or sectors with higher risk, providing an indication of risk prioritisation and the magnitude of the transition risk to which Caixa is exposed.

The heatmap was built based on the impact, across various time horizons, on the following factors:

- Direct and indirect emission costs;
- Carbon intensity of CAPEX and
- Changes in demand and revenue.

To identify the sectors of activity most vulnerable to transition risk, Caixa carried out an analysis taking into account the sectors identified by various external sources, such as the European Central Bank, United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP-FI), and Moody's, combined with expert judgement.

The following table shows CGD's exposure in the sectors considered most vulnerable to transition risk, with an impact assessment indicator, using a heatmap approach.

For the segment of loans collateralised by commercial and residential immovable property, Caixa assesses the transition risk by distributing the energy label of the properties pledged as guarantee for the operations. In parallel with the transition to a low-carbon economy, policies and market trends will indirectly affect the financial value of properties. Additionally, the energy label classification of properties will affect the alignment of the loans portfolio with CGD's commitments to carbon neutrality.

The analysis showed that the most recent operations have a greater weight in energy labels $A$ and $B$, which is in line with the business strategy of gradually moving the concentration of distribution to these energy lables.

# II. Physical Risk 

Caixa started by identifying the most relevant physical risk factors for the geographic areas where the bank is exposed. The chosen methodology considers different sources of information, namely the EU Taxonomy (EU Taxonomy - Regulation (EU) 2020/852), the 2019 Civil Protection National Risk Assessment Report, and the ThinkHazard platform (service provider recommended by the UNEP FI).

The figure below shows the weather phenomena included in the methodology, as they are considered the most relevant in terms of impact for Caixa, given the nature and location of the activity carried out by Caixa and its counterparties.
![img-176.jpeg](img-176.jpeg)

It should be noted that, although Caixa is also aware of other environmental risks such as biodiversity loss and pollution, due to the insufficiency of common methodologies and data, the bank is still analysing possible methodologies that allow for the assessment of these risks.

In order to monitor companies, Caixa carried out a preliminary assessment of the sectors most vulnerable to physical risk, based on internal analyses and the guidelines of various international initiatives and working groups, namely UNEP-FI and Moody's.

The following table shows Caixa's exposure to sectors considered most vulnerable to physical risk, with an impact assessment indicator, using a heatmap approach.

# III. ESG rating model 

CGD's innovative approach, its commitment to sustainability and its aim to evolve towards anticipating changes and controlling their potential impacts led to the creation of an internal ESG Rating Model.

The ESG Rating Model aims to complement the financial rating information, considering non-financial criteria that are equally important in terms of risk impact and viability, contributing to a forward-looking perspective on the economic and financial situation of companies and consequently to a more holistic and robust risk management. The ESG Rating is, to a certain extent, a forecast of the evolution of the financial rating in a medium-term perspective, considering that, in the medium term, the ESG criteria will be reflected on the companies' balance sheet and financial statements.

Aiming to ensure the maximisation of value for the various stakeholders, it should be noted that the objective of the ESG Rating is to promote a customer-centric vision, creating opportunities for dialogue and raising awareness among commercial areas and companies, providing advisory and anticipating needs, so as to better support companies in the process of transition to a greener and more inclusive economy.

The ESG Rating Model was implemented throughout 2021 financial year, making it possible to assess and prioritise around 400 thousand companies and $€ 23$ billion in bank loans, in terms of sustainability.

The ESG Rating methodology implemented by Caixa weighs several criteria in different dimensions and allows companies to be evaluated and prioritised based on sustainability, according to a 4-level qualitative rating scale: Strong, Good, Satisfactory and Weak.

ESG RATING: DIMENSIONS AND INDICATORS BY DIMENSION
![img-178.jpeg](img-178.jpeg)

The results for the 1st half of 2022, considering the dimensions analysed by company, namely environmental, social and governance, reveal the preservation of an acceptable exposure to ESG risks, with a concentration of exposure at levels "Good" and "Satisfactory" ( $48 \%$ and $43 \%$, respectively, with "Strong" being the best level and "Weak" being the worst level).

DISTRIBUTION OF EXPOSURE BY ESG RATING RISK LEVELS
![img-179.jpeg](img-179.jpeg)

In order to support commercial activity, four sustainable finance strategies were established and implemented in a complementary way ("Ponder", "Capture", "Enhance" and "Divest") using as inputs the correlation between the financial rating and the ESG Rating allowing to identify counterparties with the greatest potential for development and positioning, as well as counterparties at risk, with the main objective of enhancing commercial relationships and meeting the needs of companies.

![img-180.jpeg](img-180.jpeg)

Throughout 2022, the information resulting from the application of the ESG Rating Model and the methodology regarding the outlining of sustainable finance strategies has been incorporated into the following processes:

- Provision of information from the rating systems to the commercial, marketing and other credit origination areas, to serve as support for prioritising and differentiating commercial actions based on the risk level of customers, contributing to a holistic and integrated view of risk in decisionmaking processes;
- Provision of inputs for the risk management function, namely the climate stress test and risk appetite;
- Contribution to complying with regulatory requirements, namely the supervisor's expectations;
- Assessment of the vulnerability of CGD's own assets to physical risk.

Additionally, and in order to contribute to the fostering of the risk culture, 6 seminars were held with various stakeholders, titled 'CGD ESG Rating - Assessing the Sustainability of Companies'.

A new version of the ESG Rating Model is under development, to be implemented throughout 2023, aiming to strengthen and update the existing model by including new metrics, namely environmental indicators, concerning water consumption and waste treatment.

# IV. Scenario analyses and stress testing 

Scenario analyses are one of the main climate-related and environmental risk management tools, as they allow for a forward-looking assessment of existing vulnerabilities and contribute to a better understanding of the impact of these risks. This type of tool makes it possible to bring forward the enforcement of mitigating measures that prevent the materialisation of impacts with a view to the adaptation and resiliency of Caixa to climate change.

For this forward-looking and long-term sustainability approach, inherent to these risks, Caixa has invested in the development of forecasts, stress tests, sensitivity assessments and scenario analyses, considering short-, medium- and long-term scenarios, as well as different transition pathways towards carbon neutrality, considering not only the transition scenario consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement but also more adverse scenarios.

Additionally, within the scope of the commitments undertaken by CGD for carbon neutrality, medium- and long-term forecasts have been developed in order to align the credit portfolio with the defined targets.

Climate-related and environmental risk is already part of the CGD Group's stress testing framework, with short- and long-term scenarios having been developed based on a set of scenarios created by the NGFS.

It is therefore important to point out that, throughout 2022, these forward-looking approaches were taken into account when drawing up the bank's multi-annual budgeting exercise, as well as in the ICAAP exercise, where CGD also used scenario analyses to assess the impact of climate-related and environmental risk on capital adequacy.

In this context, scenarios were used that simulate the impact of an increase in the price of carbon on the credit risk of CGD customers. In terms of operational risk, CGD assesses possible impacts of low-frequency and high-severity events associated with climate-related and environmental risk drivers. In the latter, Caixa

develops loss estimates considering a series of hypothetical impacts that include an estimate of remediation costs, legal costs, regulatory sanctions, customer compensation, asset devaluation and revenue losses.

# Risk monitoring and control 

The climate-related and environmental risk management strategy was established based on the Risk Appetite Statement (RAS), which formally establishes CGD's risk appetite, detailing the maximum level of risk that the bank is willing to take for each risk category regarded as material. This risk strategy is directly related to Caixa's goals and strategic plan, which is regularly reviewed and monitored by the Board of Directors and the management team. The general principles of risk appetite derive from, and are aligned with, CGD's business strategy and an understanding of the resulting risk-benefit trade-offs.

Risk monitoring and control is also supported by a corporate governance model and incorporates the disclosure of information by means of an internal reporting system that includes the regular holding of Board Committees meetings and the disclosure of reports to various Group structures.

This methodology includes outlining, monitoring and reporting tolerance limits and risk appetite for the entire Group.

The appetite for climate-related and environmental risk is also integrated into Caixa's management via its interdependence with other exercises, namely capital and liquidity adequacy exercises (ICAAP and ILAAP), budget, capital planning and allocation, and stress-testing exercises.

The management and control of climate-related and environmental risks also includes the weighing of new variables when Caixa grants financing, such as the energy category of the property given as collateral for an operation, the companies' GHG emissions, the strategies that companies have in place for their energy transition, as well as the location of their assets, given that there are regions that are more or less exposed to weather phenomena.

Currently, the Caixa Group already acknowledges the existence of sectors of activity or projects that may contribute negatively to sustainable development, so it establishes a list of principles underlying activities and projects that are excluded or restricted, under certain conditions, from its lending policy, namely companies and activities engaged in the unlicensed trade of wildlife or endangered species; companies and projects that use scarce natural resources, whose exploitation or extraction can cause a negative environmental impact and that do not comply with the conditions set out in national or international regulations in this field, and companies that produce or process hazardous materials or substances restricted by national legislation.

Caixa has endeavoured to develop capacities to identify, assess, monitor and manage climate-related and environmental risks, which will make it possible to improve the business model's resilience to the possible impact and magnitude of these risks. A forward-looking and long-term approach is especially important given the uncertainty regarding the time horizon of manifestation of these risks, which appears to be longer term but depends on short-term action.

Caixa's response to climate-related and environmental risks involves optimising the bank's adaptive and dynamic capacity in the face of emerging national, international, political and regulatory developments on these risks. This effort is being made by all Caixa's divisions, according to a holistic and forward-looking approach.

# Metrics and targets 

CGD Group has been disclosing environmental metrics in its Sustainability Report for several years.
Climate-related and environmental risks are integrated in CGD Group's risk management framework and, therefore, integrate the bank's risk appetite, decision-making processes and strategy.

DGR regularly follows up and monitors climate-related and environmental risk indicators and the corresponding tolerance limits. The indicators that are part of the CGD Group's Risk Appetite Statement are presented on a quarterly basis to the Executive Committee, the Risk Committee and the Board of Directors of CGD.

Caixa currently monitors the following risk metrics:

| Metric | Definition |
| :--: | :--: |
| Interest, fee and commission income from GHG-intensive industries | Percentage of interest, fee and commission income stemming from GHG intensive industries in relation to interest, fee and commission income from all non-financial companies. |
| Financed GHG emissions | Exposure to carbon intensive companies based on a weighted average of carbon intensity. Includes Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from counterparties with the highest exposure by sector. |
| Credit portfolio exposure in regions more exposed to climate change risk | Percentage of exposure in the 10 worst performing industrialised countries in the Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) over total credit exposure, in the corporate segment. |

The metrics Interest, fee and commission income from GHG intensive industries and Financed GHG emissions arise from the climate stress test carried out in 2022 and have been monitored by Caixa on a regular basis.

The metric Interest, fee and commission income from GHG-intensive industries provides a proxy for the sustainability of the bank's business model and the vulnerability to the implications of transition risk.

The metric Financed GHG emissions provides an overview of the emissions financed by the bank via its corporate portfolio, particularly exposures to non-financial companies in 22 selected sectors ${ }^{17}$, providing a proxy of the bank's exposure to GHG-intensive industries and its performance in terms of portfolio alignment with the carbon neutrality commitments undertaken by CGD and the bank's strategic objectives.

For these two metrics, the sectors considered are:

| 01 | Agriculture, animal production, hunting and related service activities |
| :--: | :--: |
| $02-03$ | Forestry and logging; fishing and aquaculture |
| B | Mining and quarrying |
| $10-12$ | Manufacture of food products; beverages and tobacco products |

Notes:

1. The figures refer to non-financial companies of CGD Group.

A preliminary assessment was also carried out for regions where Caixa's carbon footprint could suffer a greater impact from transition risks, considering that exposure in countries whose government plays a weaker role in keeping global warming well below $2^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ results in a higher risk of climate change-related impacts.

The methodology used was the concentration of credit exposure in countries with the worst performance in the Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI). Published annually since 2005, the CCPI is an independent monitoring tool that assesses and compares the climate performance of 59 countries and the EU, which together account for $92 \%$ of global GHG emissions. Each country's performance is assessed in four categories: GHG emissions, renewable energy, energy use and climate policy.

The latest ranking places the following countries in the top 10 worst performing countries: Islamic Republic of Iran, Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan, Korea, Russian Federation, Canada, Taiwan, Malaysia, Australia and Poland.

The following table display the figures of this metric for 2022 and a comparison with previous years.

| Thousands of euros | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Credit portfolio exposure in regions more exposed to climate change risk | 62,394 | 122,298 | 105,612 |
|  | $0.36 \%$ | $0.70 \%$ | $0.61 \%$ |

Notes:

1. The figures refer to the corporate segment of Caixa Geral de Depósitos, SA, domestic perimeter.

Throughout 2022, the indicators visibly remained within the risk appetite limits.
The ongoing sensitivity and scenario assessments, as well as the stress testing exercises for climate-related and environmental risks will largely contribute to a better understanding of the impact of these risks and to a dynamic adaptation of risk appetite and business strategy. This will enable the outlining of new risk indicators that take into account different transition pathways and different time horizons, as well as new performance indicators that will enable measuring the alignment of the credit portfolio with the carbon neutrality commitments undertaken by Caixa and the bank's performance vis-à-vis the interim targets established.

# Environmental indicators 

Through its annual sustainability report, Caixa publicly discloses a set of relevant information for its stakeholders.

In 2021, Caixa included for the first time in its sustainability report the reporting of scope 3 emissions Investments (Category 15). This exercise was carried out again in 2022 in accordance with the guidelines of the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF), a collaborative initiative aiming to put together methodologies for calculating and reporting emissions associated with the credit and investment portfolio of financial institutions.

## Environmental Targets

Caixa undertook to reduce 43\% of global GHG emissions (scopes 1 and 2) by 2021, compared to 2015. This objective was set out based on a tool developed by one of the main international trends, the Science Based Targets Initiative, adding five percentage points to the simulation. The bank successfully achieved and exceeded the objective set out, reducing GHG emissions by $73 \%$ compared to the baseline year. Caixa is currently in the process of validating new emission reduction targets with SBTi by 2030.

Additionally, in line with the commitment undertaken within the scope of its signing up to the Net Zero Banking Alliance and in order to meet the expectations of its stakeholders, namely investors, regarding the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, Caixa will disclose, in 2023, its Transition Plan for carbon neutrality.

The document will lay down GHG emission targets and the respective activities to be carried out for the electricity generation, real estate and cement sectors, in order to contribute to limiting the temperature increase to $1.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ throughout its value chain. For the 2023/2024 biennium, Caixa will set out reduction targets for the remaining sectors identified by the United Nations Environment Programme - Finance Initiative (UNEP-FI), namely agriculture, aluminium, coal, iron and steel, oil and gas and transport.

# Environmental corporate ratings or ESG ratings 

Caixa voluntarily participates, on an annual basis, in the CDP, one of the main contemporary environmental indices. This assessment serves as an important tool to identify and assess the climate risks and opportunities associated with its activity.

## Opportunity metrics

Throughout 2022, Caixa successfully performed two green senior preferred debt issuances amounting to 500 and 300 million euros. As a sustainable financing instrument, the funds raised are used to finance credit operations within the areas of environment and socioeconomic development. The sustainable finance framework for bonds provides for the issuance of three types of instruments (i) Green Financing Instruments, (ii) Social Financing Instruments and (iii) Sustainability Financing Instruments.

In 2022 Caixa Banco de Investimento (CBI), an entity of the Caixa SA Group, maintained its highly focused approach to the ESG dimension, having led 13 sustainable debt operations, namely:

With regard to sustainability, in 2022 Caixa Gestão de Ativos (CXA) reinforced its ambition to set itself up as an example in carrying out Socially Responsible Investments, reinforcing its approach to action, which remains centred on three main vectors: 1) Integration of ESG factors in investment processes, alongside the use of traditional financial analysis factors; 2) Involvement with the companies subject to investments through the exercise of voting rights associated with assets under management; and 3) Involvement with companies that fit into the potential universe of investment, fostering a close dialogue on matters concerning Socially Responsible Investment (Engagement).

CXA incorporates ESG criteria into all of its global assets, with emphasis on the total amount of investment funds under management that promote social and/or environmental characteristics and that comply with all provisions of CXA's Socially Responsible Investment Policy (ISR).

## Independent Limited Assurance Report

To the Board of Directors of
Caixa Geral de Depósitos, S.A.

## Scope

We have been engaged by Caixa Geral de Depósitos, S.A. ("CGD") to perform a limited assurance engagement, as defined by International Standards on Assurance Engagements, to report on the sustainability disclosures included in the Sustainability Report 2022, identified in the chapter "Annex B - Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Index", which includes the sustainability information included in the Annual Report 2022 (the "Sustainability Information"), for the year ended 31 December 2022.

## Criteria applied

CGD prepared the Sustainability Information in accordance with the sustainability reporting standards of the Global Reporting Initiative - GRI Standards and with the provisions of article 508. ${ }^{\circ}$-G of the Commercial Companies Code (Código das Sociedades Comerciais) and article 29. ${ }^{\circ}-\mathrm{H}, \mathrm{n}^{\circ} 1$, paragraph q) of the Securities Code (Código dos Valores Mobiliários) with respect to non-financial and diversity disclosures (together the "Criteria").

## Responsibilities of the Management

CGD's management is responsible for selecting the Criteria, and for preparing the Sustainability Information in accordance with that Criteria, in all material respects. This responsibility includes establishing and maintaining an appropriate internal control system, maintaining adequate records and making estimates that are relevant to the preparation of the Sustainability Information, such that it is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

## Responsibilities of the Auditor

Our responsibility is to examine the Sustainability Information prepared by CGD and to issue a limited assurance report based on the evidence obtained.

Our engagement was conducted in accordance with the International Standards for Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information - ISAE 3000 (Revised) issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) and other technical standards and recommendations issued by the Portuguese Institute of Statutory Auditors (Ordem dos Revisores Oficiais de Contas). These standards require that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether, in all material respects, the Sustainability Information is prepared in accordance with the Criteria.

Procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. In these circumstances, our independent review procedures comprised the following:

- Inquiries to management with the objective to understand the business context and the sustainability reporting process;
- Conducting interviews with personnel responsible for preparing the information in order to understand the processes for collecting, collating, reporting and validating of the Sustainability Information for the reporting period;

- Conducting analytical review procedures to support the reasonableness of the data;
- Execution, on a sample basis, of tests to the calculations carried out, as well as tests to prove the quantitative and qualitative information included in the report;
- Verification of the conformity of the Sustainability Information with the results of our work and with the Criteria applied.

We consider that the evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide the basis for our conclusion.

# Quality and Independence 

We apply the International Standard on Quality Control 1 and, accordingly, maintain a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

We comply with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Ordem dos Revisores Oficiais de Contas' Code of ethics and of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including international independence standards) (IESBA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentially and professional behavior.

## Conclusion

Based on our work and evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that cause us to believe that the Sustainability Information, for the year ended 31 December 2022, has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.

## Statutory and Auditor's Report

## REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Opinion

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Caixa Geral de Depósitos, S.A. ("CGD" or "the Group"), which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022 (showing a total of 102,503,009 thousand of euros and a total equity of 9,482,661 thousand of euros, including a net income attributable to the shareholder of CGD of 842,786 thousand of euros), and the Consolidated Income Statement, Statement of Comprehensive Income, Statement of Changes in Equity and Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended, and the Annex with the notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view, in all material respects, of the consolidated financial position of Caixa Geral de Depósitos, S.A. as of December 31, 2022, and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the European Union.

## Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and other technical and ethical standards and guidelines as issued by the Institute of Statutory Auditors. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the "Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements" section below. We are independent of the entities comprising the Group in accordance with the law and we have fulfilled other ethical requirements in accordance with the Institute of Statutory Auditors' code of ethics.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

## Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

The key audit matters in the current year audit are the following:

1. Impairment of financial assets - loans and advances to customers

## Description of the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement

As presented in the balance sheet and as further disclosed in notes 13 and 38 of the Annex to the consolidated financial statements, the value of loans and advances to customers amounted to $53,032,491$ thousand of euros representing around $50 \%$ of total gross assets. The accumulated impairment recorded to loans to customers amounted to $2,254,541$ thousand of euros representing $4,3 \%$ of total credit.

The impairment of loans and advances to customers represents the best estimate, by CGD's management bodies and those of its subsidiaries, of expected losses from its client portfolio taking into consideration the requirements of IFRS 9 - 'Financial Instruments'. Losses from impairment of loans and advances measured at amortised cost are determined by application of the accounting policies, methodologies, concepts, and assumptions used by the Group and disclosed in notes 2.7 D and 43 - "Credit Risk" nr. 6 to nr. 10 of the Annex to the consolidated financial statements. This evaluation results from consideration a several number of factors that reflect an understanding of the clients' current situation, an analysis of historical information, the value of related collaterals, beside others, with the use of a high level of judgement (note 2.20 a)).

The worsening of the current macroeconomic environment, resulting from increases in energy prices, inflation, interest rates and constraints on supply and production chains, could lead to an increase in the situations of customers in financial difficulties and non-performing loans. In this context, in addition to modifying the forwardlooking parameters in the valuation model, CGD changed the methodology and performed various sensitivity analyses to identify scenarios of possible deterioration within the client portfolio which might cause a downgrade in credit status. After concluding these analyses, CGD recorded an additional amount to cover potential expected losses that had not been identified by the current impairment model (Note 43 - "Credit Risk" nr. 10 "Russian-Ukrainian conflict - potential impacts in credit portfolio - Additional impairment (Overlays')" of the Annex to the consolidated financial statements).

Considering the materiality, the degree of subjectivity and complexity involved, changes in recovery strategies and judgements made, or assumptions which determine the amount and timing of cash flows, may have a material impact in the estimated impairment, consequently, this is a key audit matter.

## Summary of our response to the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement

Our response to the risk of material misstatements includes a combined approach of controls assessment and substantive procedures, namely:

Understand, evaluate the design and test the operational effectiveness of internal control procedures over the process of impairment losses quantification to the credit portfolio;

Perform analytical review procedures on the Group' credit portfolio balances and impairment, comparing to the previous period and to defined expectations, including understanding of the changes occurred in the credit portfolio and changes in the assumptions and methodologies of impairment;

Understanding of the measures taken by the Group to ensure adequate monitoring and marking of exposures covered by the moratorium, the identification of sectors of activity or other specific subgroups most exposed to the effects of the current macroeconomic context and processes designed to proactively address them and thus capture risk degradations and associated expected losses;

Sampling a group of exposures individually assessed for impairment to test the assumptions used by the Group's Management and subsidiaries, to quantify impairment. This analysis included a review of the business models, the financial situation of the debtors and the valuation reports of collateral and enquiries to understand the recovery strategy of the loans as well an assessment of the assumptions used and the estimated potential impacts of the current macroeconomic environment on the debtor or the specific business activity;

Use of internal specialists to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions used for the collective assessment of impairment, with particular regard to the following procedures: (i) understand approved and formal methodology and comparison with methodology effectively in place, (ii) analysis of changes of the model on the definition of parameters to reflect the loss incurred; (iii) analysis of the changes in risk parameters (PD, LGD and EAD) that occurred during 2022; (iv) tests, on a sample basis, of the underlying data used to determine the risk parameters and comparison with source information; (v) evaluation of the consistent application of calculations of risk parameters throughout the period under review; (vi) enquiries of Group's experts responsible for the models and analysis of internal audit and regulator's reports; and (vii) analysis of the reports with the results of the operational evaluation of the model (back testing);

Assessment of the reasonableness of adjustments, those to respond to additional areas of judgment resulting from the current macroeconomic context, and review of management procedures associated with such adjustments; and

Analysis of the disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements, based on International Financial Reporting Standards requirements and on the accounting records.

2. Recoverability of deferred tax assets

## Description of the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement

The Balance Sheet records deferred tax assets in the amount of 967,858 thousand of euros, of which 102,959 thousand of euros is covered by the special regime applicable to deferred tax assets (REAID), as detailed in Note 2.13 and Note 19 of the Annex to the consolidated financial statements.

Under the requirements of IAS 12 - "Income taxes", deferred tax assets are recognized considering the Group's estimation of its future recoverability, which is essentially determined by its capacity to generate future taxable profits and on an understanding of the legal framework applicable in the reversal period as described in Note 2.20 f) of the Annex to the consolidated financial statements.

This assessment was carried out based on the implementation of CGD's Strategic Plan and the application of the rules of deductibility in impairment for credit risk defined in Law Nr. 98/2019.

Any deviations that may materialize differently from the scenarios considered in the estimate of future tax results, or possible changes in the applicable tax legislation or in the assumptions and interpretations used for its determination, may have material impacts on the value of deferred tax assets, which justifies this being a key audit matter.

## Summary of our response to the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement

Our response to the risk of material misstatements includes the following procedures:

- Understanding of the internal control procedures in the process of estimating the recoverability of deferred tax assets;
- Understanding of the main assumptions and judgments considered by the Group to estimate the future evolution of pre-tax results, including the analysis of their consistency with the projections of the Strategic Plan and considering the current macroeconomic context;
- Involvement of internal experts in tax matters for the analysis of the assumptions used in the estimation of deferred tax assets, considering the application of the rules of deductibility in impairment for credit risk defined by Law No. 98/2019;
- Review of the calculations made by the Group to demonstrate the recoverability of deferred tax assets, considering the understanding of the assumptions used in the estimation of pre-tax results and the review of the interpretation of tax legislation; and
- Review of the disclosures in the Annex to the consolidated financial statements relating to this matter, based on the requirements of international financial reporting standards and accounting records.


## 3. Liabilities with post-employment benefits of Group' employees and commitments undertaken under the early retirement plan

## Description of the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement

CGD and certain subsidiaries assumed responsibility for current and retired employees' retirement benefits and other long-term postemployment benefits (Note 2.15 of the Annex to the consolidated financial statements).

As of December 31, 2022, the total liabilities estimated for past service post-employment benefits of Group's employees and retirees amount to $2,775,772$ thousand of euros and medical post-employment benefits to 309,231 thousand of euros (Note 36 of the Annex to the consolidated financial statements).

In addition, given the current context and considering the structural changes in the banking business, the extension of the CGD Group's PreReform Program until 2024 was approved. In this context, with reference to 31 December 2022, CGD estimated a provision of 137,580 thousand

## Summary of our response to the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement

Our response to the risk of material misstatements included the following procedures:

- Understanding internal controls over the estimation process of postemployment benefits related to pensions, other long-term employee benefits and commitments undertaken under the early retirement plan;
- Performance of analytical review procedures of the balances of postemployment liabilities comparing with previous periods and expectations based on an understanding of the variations of the number of employees and retirees and changes of assumptions;
- Verification of "ASF" registry related to the external actuary in charge of actuarial report and read of the independence declaration attached to the actuarial report as of December 31, 2022;
- Use of internal actuarial specialists to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions used, as compared to external benchmarks, historical information, information provided by Group's management and to review on a sample basis, the calculations performed by the external actuary;

## Description of the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement

of euros for the Pre-Retirement Program ("PRP"), as referred in Note 36.

The liabilities for retirement pensions and other post-employment benefits, as well as the estimated liabilities for the PRP, were estimated on the basis of actuarial assessments prepared by an external actuary certified by the Insurance and Pension Funds Supervisory Authority ("ASF"), which incorporate a set of financial and actuarial assumptions defined by CGD's management body, in particular as regards the discount rate, the rate of wage and pension growth and the mortality and invalidity tables, as referred to in Note 2.20 e) of the Annex to the consolidated financial statements.

On February 24, 2023, the Decree-Law 14/2023 was published, which provides for the transfer of pension liabilities to Caixa Geral de Aposentações (CGA), with the delivery by CGD to CGA of financial compensation in the amount of 3,018,340 thousand of euros and subsequent extinction and liquidation of CGD's Pension Fund. The difference of 245,772 thousand of euros between the amount of compensation and the estimated liabilities was recognized as a liability for consideration of Personnel Costs.

Under the terms of the above-mentioned DecreeLaw, the risk associated with possible deviations between the growth rates of wages and pensions used as assumptions in the operation and the those that will come to fruition, remains until the end of 2027 and a compensation mechanism for CGA has been defined by CGD, to be assessed in 2028 with reference to 31 December 2027, with a maximum value of 320,000 thousand of euros. With reference to December 31, 2022, this contingent liability has been assessed as null and will be subject to future reassessment every six months.

The use of different methodologies, assumptions, or judgments in the application of actuarial calculations may lead to different estimates of their book value, which justifies this being a key audit matter.

## Summary of our response to the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement

- Analysis of the commitments agreed in the document establishing the pension fund and the liabilities considered in the actuarial report as of December 31, 2022 as well as the regulations regarding postemployment medical benefits;
- Testing, on a sample basis, of the data included in the actuarial report;
- Analysis of the accounting framework adopted for the transfer of responsibilities to CGA transaction, taking into account the provisions of Decree-Law no. 14/2023;
- Analysis of the commitments agreed in the early retirement plan and of the data used in the estimation prepared by CGD as well as of the analysis of the accounting treatment of the liability under the requirements of IAS 37; and
- Analysis of the disclosures included on the consolidated financial statements, based on International Financial Reporting Standards requirements and on the accounting records.

4. Financial instruments measured at fair value and classified as level 3 under IFRS 13

## Description of the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement

As described in Note 43 to the Annex to the consolidated financial statements - in the chapter "Long-term or economic outlook - fair value", as of December 31, 2022, the Group holds a set of financial instruments, in the amount of 1,116,179 thousand of euros, measured at fair value using valuation techniques that incorporate variables not observable in the market (Level 3, in the context of IFRS 13 - "Fair Value Measurement").

The valuation of assets classified as level 3 is by inherence subjective, given that these financial instruments are valued based on internal models and criteria used in CGD or through quotations provided by external entities that include unobservable market parameters.

In addition, in the current macroeconomic environment, uncertainty about the estimate of the fair value of instruments that have underlying real estate assets has increased due to potential effects on (i) the volume and value of reference transactions of similar and comparable assets, (ii) the extension of the maturities to complete real estate assets under construction, (iii) cash flows arising from leased assets, (iv) the discount rates considered, (v) the ability to lease unoccupied assets and (vi) the premium risk required by potential investors.

The use of different valuation techniques and assumptions may give rise to different estimates of fair value (Note 2.20 c) of the Annex to the consolidated financial statements), namely arising from the possible impacts of the current macroeconomic context on the evolution of the real estate market, which justifies this being a relevant audit matter.

## 5. Resolution fund

## Description of the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement

As disclosed in note 24 'Resolution Fund' following the resolution measures applied to Banco Espírito Santo, S.A. ("BES") and Banif Banco Internacional do Funchal, S.A. ("Banif"), the Resolution Fund was granted loans by the Portuguese State and a banking syndicate and has assumed other obligations and contingent liabilities. CGD has participated in the banking syndicate through a loan agreement, celebrated in August 2014, amounting to 174.3 million euros (corresponding to about $25 \%$ of the total).

As described in a public statement by the Resolution Fund on 21 March 2017, the terms of the loans granted to the Resolution Fund to

## Summary of our response to the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement

Our response to the risk of material misstatements included the following procedures:

- Understanding internal control over the valuation process of financial instruments non-quoted on active market;
- Performance of analytical review procedures on the balances of financial instruments comparing with the previous period and expectations to obtain an understanding of the variations that occurred regarding changes in assumptions and methodologies;
- On the internal models used we performed the following procedures: (i) understanding the formal methodology approved by management, (ii) analysis, on a sample basis of financial instruments, of the underlying data used in the internal models, (iii) recalculation of the fair value of the financial instruments on a sample basis;
- For the recovery funds and close-ended funds, our analysis was based on the latest financial information available and/or the last net asset value disclosed by the management entities of the funds and on the reports by the Group on the value of the underlying assets of the funds. Regarding the evaluation of real estate assets held by these funds, internal specialists analysed the appropriateness of valuation methods applied and the reasonableness of assumptions used in the valuation of a sample of assets; and
- Analysis of the disclosures to the consolidated financial statements, based on International Financial Reporting Standards requirements and on the accounting records.


## Summary of our response to the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement

Our response to the risk of material misstatements includes the following procedures:

- Analysis of the loan agreement concluded between CGD and the Resolution Fund, celebrated in August 2014, and the respective amendments signed in August 2016, February 2017 and May 2021;

finance the resolution measures for BES and Banif were renegotiated during the first quarter of 2017, including an extension of the term of the loans to 31 December 2046 and the possibility to further adjust that term to enable the Resolution Fund to settle the liabilities based on regular contributions without reliance on special contributions or other extraordinary contributions by the banking sector. It was also specified the treatment of the loans of the Resolution Fund to the banking syndicate, of which CGD is a part, pari passu with loans granted by the Portuguese State.

In addition, in May 2021 a new credit opening agreement was signed for 475 million euros, in which CGD participated with the amount of 118.4 million euros. In this contract the pari passu treatment was maintained in relation to the previous loans.

According to information released in the latest Report and Accounts of the Resolution Fund, at 31 December 2021, loans obtained from the State and the banking syndicate amounted to 6,383 million euros and 1,129 million euros, respectively, and negative own resources at 7,208 million euros.

To reimburse these loans and to meet other obligations, the financial resources of the Resolution Fund are essentially provided by periodic contributions from participating institutions (including CGD) and contributions from the banking sector. There is also a provision for the Portuguese Government finance representative to require, by ministerial order, that participating institutions make a special contribution in circumstances determined in the legislation, particularly if the Resolution Fund does not have sufficient funds to meet its obligations.

CGD does not expect to be called on for any contributions or other extraordinary payments to finance the resolution measures for BES and Banif. The cost of the regular contributions and the contribution of the banking sector is recognised annually in accordance with IFRIC 21 - Levies. However, any eventual changes in the application of the financing mechanism of the Resolution Fund described above could have a significant impact on future financial statements of CGD.

# Responsibilities of management and the supervisory board for the consolidated financial statements 

Management is responsible for:

- the preparation of consolidated financial statements that presents a true and fair view of the Group's financial position, financial performance and cash flows in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the European Union;
- the preparation of the Management Report, Corporate Governance Report, including a chapter related to remuneration, and the Consolidated Non-financial statement in accordance with the laws and regulations;
- designing and maintaining an appropriate internal control system to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;
- the adoption of accounting policies and principles appropriate in the circumstances; and
- assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, and disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.

The supervisory body is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.

## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements

Our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken based on these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;
- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control;
- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management;
- conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group 's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;
- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;
- obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision, and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion;

![img-185.jpeg](img-185.jpeg)

- communicate with those charged with governance, including the supervisory body, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit;
- from the matters communicated with those charged with governance, including the supervisory body, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter; and
- we also provide the supervisory body with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the measures we took to eliminate those matters or the related safeguards we applied.

Our responsibility additionally includes the verification of the consistency of the Management Report with the consolidated financial statements, and the verifications under nr. 4 and nr. 5 of article 451 of the Commercial Companies Code regarding corporate governance, as well as verifying that the Consolidated Non-financial statement was presented.

# REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS 

## On the Management Report

Pursuant to article 451, nr. 3, paragraph e) of the Commercial Companies Code, it is our opinion that the Management Report was prepared in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory requirements and the information contained therein is consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements and, having regard to our knowledge and assessment over the Group, we have not identified any material misstatement.

## On the Corporate Governance Report

Pursuant to article 451, nr. 4 of the Commercial Companies code, in our opinion, the Corporate Governance Report includes the information required to the Group to provide as per article 29 H of the Securities Code, and we have not identified material misstatements on the information provided therein in compliance with paragraphs c), d), f), h), i) and l) of nr. 1 of this article.

## On the non-financial statement provided

## On additional items set out in article 10 of the Regulation (EU) nr. 537/2014

Pursuant to article 10 of the Regulation (EU) nr. 537/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 16 April 2014, and in addition to the key audit matters mentioned above, we also report the following:

- We were appointed as statutory auditors of Caixa Geral de Depósitos, S.A. (Group's Parent Entity) for the first time by decision of the sole shareholder the Portuguese State, dated 18 May 2017, for the period from 2017 to 2020. We were reappointed in the shareholders' general meeting held on 31 May 2021 for a second mandate from 2021 to 2024;
- Management has confirmed that they are not aware of any fraud or suspicion of fraud having occurred that has a material effect on the financial statements. In planning and executing our audit in accordance with ISAs we maintained professional skepticism and we designed audit procedures to respond to the possibility of material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements due to fraud. As a result of our work we have not identified any material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements due to fraud;
- We confirm that our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report that we have prepared and delivered to the supervisory body of the Group today; and
- We declare that we have not provided any prohibited services as described in article 5 of the Regulation (EU) nr. 537/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 16 April 2014, and we have remained independent of the Group in conducting the audit.

# European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of CGD for the year ended December 31, 2022, must comply with the applicable requirements set out in the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 of 17 December 2018 (ESEF Regulation).

Management is responsible for preparing and disclosing the annual report in accordance with the ESEF Regulation.

Our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements, included in the annual report, are presented in accordance with the requirements set out in the ESEF Regulation.

Our procedures were performed according to the Technical Application Guide ("Guia de Aplicação Técnica") of the Portuguese Institute of Statutory Auditors ("Ordem dos Revisores Oficiais de Contas") on reporting in ESEF and included, among others:

- gaining understanding of the financial reporting process, including the submission of the annual report in valid XHTML format; and
- the identification and assessment of the risks of material distortion associated with the tagging of the consolidated financial statements information, in XBRL format using iXBRL technology. This assessment was based on an understanding of the process implemented by the Group to tag the information.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in the annual report are presented, in all material respects, in accordance with the requirements set out in the ESEF Regulation.

("CGD" or "bank").

## Remit of the audit committee

The audit committee, as the bank's supervisory body, without prejudice to any other statutory and legally assigned functions, as set out in article 423-F of the commercial companies code, article 3 of the legal regime governing audit supervision, Bank of Portugal notice no. 3/2020 and other legislation and applicable regulations, is responsible for: (i) supervising the management of the company; (ii) ensuring compliance with the law and the company's articles of association; (iii) supervising the process for the preparation and disclosure of financial information; (iv) overseeing a review of the accounts and the auditing of the company's accounting documents; (v) proposing the appointment of the statutory audit company to the general meeting and supervising its independence, particularly as regards the provision of additional, non-audit services; (vi) promoting, monitoring and assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of the organisational culture and CGD's and CGD group's governance and internal control systems; (vii) supervising the effectiveness of the activity and independence of control functions and, (viii) ensuring the direct reporting and supervision of the performance of the attributes of the internal audit function.

Having initiated its term of office as CGD's supervisory body on 23 December 2021, the audit committee approved the following, in early 2022, (i) its internal regulation which establishes the rules governing its composition and appointment, remit, organisation and operation, in addition to the principles and operating standards that should govern the performance of its members in exercising their respective functions, as a complement to the applicable legal and statutory provisions and (ii) the committee's multiannual activities plan, which details and systemises the activities necessary for full compliance with the functions and responsibilities assigned to it.

In consideration of all of the supervisory activity carried out and described below, the audit committee considers that it has diligently complied with all of its attributes and has made a positive assessment of its contribution to improving CGD's internal control system and the effectiveness of its control functions, in group terms. Reference should also be made to its contribution to overseeing the processes for the preparation and disclosure of financial information and on the statutory audit, considering that its interactions and the issues raised in this context have been relevant and highly useful in drawing attention to the main risks that could impact these processes.

$\checkmark \quad$ Impairment of financial assets - loans and advances to customers;
$\checkmark$ Recoverability of deferred tax assets;
$\checkmark$ Liabilities for the post employment benefits of CGD employees and the commitments made under the pre-retirement programme;
$\checkmark$ Financial instruments measured at fair value and classified at IFRS 13 level 3;
$\checkmark$ Resolution fund.

In addition to the above identified relevant audit matters the audit committee also oversaw EY's analysis of other areas in focus which also merited the special attention of the auditor and the supervisory body, such as those related to the possible risk of a derogation from the controls on lending by the management body, the risks of the inappropriate measurement of revenue owing to the incorrect application of accounting policies, transactions/assets whose measurement/valuation are underpinned by subjective judgments and assumptions, namely the valuation of properties received under loan recovery operations, assessment of the probability of the outcome of judicial disputes, claims and defaults and the valuation/recoverability of non-financial assets.

The audit committee has also assessed compliance with the legal guidelines in force for the state's business sector, regarding compliance with remuneration guidelines in force in 2022 and the guidelines relating to the corporate governance report included in the accounting documents.

It also noted that the information on corporate governance includes the elements required under article 29H of the securities code.

In view of the above, the following opinion has been issued:

# ANNEX TO THE REPORT AND OPINION OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 

## DISCLOSURES UNDER THE TERMS OF BANK OF PORTUGAL NOTICE 3/2020

## Introduction

In compliance with the requirement of article 60 of the Bank of Portugal's notice no. 3/2020 the audit committee provides a summary of the self-assessment reports on the adequacy and effectiveness of the organisational culture and governance and internal control systems of Caixa Geral de Depósitos, S.A. ("CGD" or "Institution") and of CGD group's internal control system, as reported to the Bank of Portugal on 31 December 2021 ("Reports"), with reference to the period between 1 February 2021 and 30 November 2021 ("Reference Period").

Under the terms of articles 2 and 54 of the notice, the institution's management and supervisory boards are responsible, under the terms of their respective remit, for:

- Promoting the existence, within the institution, of an organisational culture based on high ethical standards in accordance with the requirements of article 2 of the notice;
- Ensuring that the institution's organisational culture and governance and internal control systems, including its remuneration practices and policies and other matters addressed in the notice, are adequate and effective and promote sound, prudent management;
- Ensuring that the institution assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of the organisational culture in force within the institution and its governance and internal control systems; and
- Preparing an annual report setting out the results of the referred to evaluation in accordance with the requirements of article 55 ("Report").

The report contains the assessment of the institution's supervisory body on the date of the report (supervisory board in office up until 22 December 2021) under the terms of article 56, the board of directors' assessment under the terms of article 57 and the reports of the officers responsible for the risk management, compliance and internal audit functions referred to in sub-paragraph s) of no. 1 of article 27, sub-paragraph p) of no. 1 of article 28 and sub-paragraph d) of no. 1 of article 32, with regard to the reference period.

Under the terms of nos. 3 and 4 of article 54 of the notice, the parent company's board of directors is responsible for preparing an annual self-assessment report on the financial group, enabling a conclusion to be reached on the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's internal control system ("group report").

Under the terms of the notice, the institution's board of directors is responsible for ensuring that:

- the Group is organised in a transparent manner under the terms of the provisions of article 49 of the notice;
- all of the Group's subsidiaries implement internal control systems which are consistent with each other and in conformity with the requirements set out in the notice;
- the institution has an internal control system which meets the requirements of article 51 of the notice;
- the institution's internal control functions are commensurate with the size and nature of the Group's activities for meeting the requirements of article 52 of the notice; and
- an annual self-assessment report on the group and a separate report on each of the entities subject to supervision on a consolidated basis is produced, in accordance with the requirements of articles 54 and 55 of the notice.

As established in sub-paragraphs b) and c) of article 58 of the notice, the supervisory body is responsible for including an assessment of the following in the referred to annual report, as part of its lawfully attributed responsibilities:

- the adequacy and effectiveness of the institution's internal group control system to ensure compliance with the requirements of article 51 of the notice; and
- the consistency between the internal control systems of subsidiaries and the institution's internal control system, which evaluation may be based on the assessments produced for this purpose by the supervisory bodies of each of the subsidiaries.

# Inherent limitations 

The board of directors and the supervisory board in office at the time stated that they were aware of the limitations inherent to any internal control system which, irrespective of its level of adequacy and effectiveness, can only provide management and supervision with a reasonable level of security in achieving the objectives in terms of organisational culture, governance and internal control systems, in addition to the other matters set out in the notice. Accordingly, owing to the inherent limitations of internal control systems, irregularities, fraud or errors can occur without being detected.

Additionally, the audit committee highlighted that:

- The assessment of the impact of the deficiencies is estimated by CGD's board of directors and complies with the criteria established in the institution and classification process in accordance with established criteria and assumptions. Given the judgements involved in the definition of the criteria, assumptions and assessment of the impacts, different classifications could be attributed to the deficiencies if different criteria were followed or assumptions made. Similarly, an assessment of the same deficiency, made at another time, could come to different conclusions and the impact of a deficiency could materialise other than in the way it was estimated; and
- Taking the normal dynamics of any internal control system into account, the conclusions presented should not be used to make any projection on future periods on a level of the referred to system's implementation insofar as there may be changes in the processes and controls implemented.


## Self-assessment report on Caixa Geral de Depósitos, S.A.

The report's structure and contents are in line with the provisions of article 2 of the Bank of Portugal's instruction no. 18/2020.

Under the terms of the definitions of articles 55 and 57 of the notice, CGD's board of directors stated, in its self-assessment report that, taking into account the measures implemented, the oversight activities, the results known, namely the reduction in the number and severity of deficiencies, greater compliance with the deadlines and strengthening of the control framework as embodied in the review of the deficiencies management policy, that it considers, without prejudice to the limitations indicated, with a reasonable level of certainty, that CGD's organisational culture, current governance and internal control systems, including remuneration practices and policies, in addition to the other matters set out in the notice, are globally effective and commensurate with the nature and magnitude of the risks associated with the institution's activity.

The board of directors wishes to highlight the remarkable transformation which has taken place in CGD group, as a result of the implementation and consolidation of the strategic plan for control functions.

The board of directors also stated that it would continue to focus on all opportunities to improve the internal control system and other matters referred to in the notice, persisting with commitment and determination, in taking the necessary steps and, in particular, strengthening CGD's internal governance and risk culture.

Under the terms of article 56 of the notice, CAUD (audit committee) has stated in its evaluation report that it has overseen and monitored CGD's internal control system during the reference period based on: (i) its oversight of compliance with the internal control deficiencies management policy as regards the project for recovering the backlog of situations identified; (ii) its regular consideration of the status of unresolved deficiencies and the periodic reports on such deficiencies, prepared by the control functions; (iii) its regular meetings with directors; (iv) its consideration of the internal audit reports and follow-up activities on the resolution of deficiencies identified by the internal audit division ("DAI"); and (v) its follow-up of activities involving the resolution of deficiencies detected by the statutory auditors and regulatory entities.

Based on its oversight activities and analysis of documentation, CAUD considers that CGD's management and administration bodies continue to promote structural changes in terms of CGD's organisational culture and its governance and internal control systems.

In this context, reference should be made to the following positive developments in the period in question:

- The substantial implementation of the strategic plan on control functions defined in 2019. The strategic plans on control functions defined for 2022-2024 also continue to include initiatives to strengthen their performance as second and third lines of defence; and
- The initiatives to reduce the internal control deficiencies described in the report. In this context, CAUD wishes to highlight the continuity of positive evolution in terms of the resolution of the deficiencies identified with reference to 30 November 2022, as a result of the evaluation and oversight project on all

existing deficiencies in CGD (including CGD Portugal, France Branch, Timor Branch and Caixa Serviços Partilhados, A.C.E.).

The work carried out shows that the regulations on control functions comply with the requirements of articles 27, 28 and 32 of the notice. In addition, as a result of the effectiveness tests performed on each requirement, no new high/critical risk deficiencies were identified. The insufficiencies and opportunities for improvement identified have been incorporated into the records database for subsequent management and oversight.

The supervisory board also stated that it has taken note of the reports of the officers responsible for the risk management, compliance and internal audit functions referred to in sub-paragraph s) of no. 1 of article 27 and sub-paragraph p) of no. 1 of article 28, and d) no. 1 of article 32, respectively, in which no constraints on the level of independence of functions have been reported. Likewise, the audit committee was not aware of the existence of constraints.

As regards the internal audit function's reports under the notice, in addition to the internal audit division's report, as provided for in sub-paragraph e) of no. 1 of article 2 of instruction no. 18/2020 on the classification of deficiencies, the supervisory board has taken note of the "Opinion of the internal audit function on the self-assessment report on the adequacy and effectiveness of the organisational culture and internal governance and control systems of Caixa Geral de Depósitos, S.A. - separate activity ("Statement of Compliance"), issued on 19 December 2022. This report was issued under the terms of liability of the certification of the self-assessment report of the board of directors under the notice, attributed in the internal control deficiencies management policy and was intended to assess compliance with the report, for materially relevant aspects, existing regulatory provisions and adequate reflection of the deficiencies registered in CGD's internal control deficiencies database. The internal audit division has concluded that the report complies, in materially relevant aspects, with the existing regulatory provisions and reflects the deficiencies recorded in CGD's internal control deficiencies database.

On 19 December 2022 the internal audit division also provided the audit committee with the report referred to in sub-paragraph c) of no. 1 of article 32) of the notice, which presents an overall assessment that:

- Based on work carried out by the internal audit function and considering the diverse projects and improvements implemented and in progress, in addition to the reduction in the number of unresolved deficiencies and greater speed of their resolution, it considers that CGD has been developing, restructuring and implementing multiple processes that have enabled it to strengthen its organisational culture and governance and internal control systems; and
- Based on the work carried out, considering deficiencies pending resolution and ongoing projects, highlighting the existence of deficiencies to be resolved by the control functions, it is of the opinion that the institution's organisational culture and its governance and internal control systems are globally commensurate with the nature and magnitude of the risks associated with CGD's business, even if improvements could be made to them in order to improve their effectiveness and make constant adjustments to business challenges and regulatory dynamics.

The independent external valuations on CGD, regarding: (i) CGD's conduct and values, including the conduct and values of its management bodies, committees and CAUD, in accordance with nos. 2 and 3 of article 3 of the notice; (ii) the processes for obtaining, producing and processing the implementation of information in CGD, in addition to their control mechanisms, as provided for in no. 7 of article 29 of the notice; and (iii) the conformity of information flows established with the requirements of article 30 of the notice, have not yet been implemented. The board of directors has stated in the report that these assessments will be made by the end of 2024.

In order to form its opinion, CAUD considered the current and potential impacts of high risk deficiencies that remain unresolved and, in view of the above, on the basis of the known results deriving from the activities which have already been performed and bearing in mind the improvements implemented, subject to the limitation arising from the failure to carry out the independent assessments by an external entity under the terms of the notice and without prejudice to any impacts of: (i) the deficiencies identified in the report; (ii) the insufficiencies still identified in SREP 2022 Decision; and (iii) the above referred to inherent limitations, CAUD considers with a reasonable level of certainty that CGD's organisational culture, its current governance and internal control systems are, in materially relevant aspects, globally effective and appropriate to the nature and magnitude of the risks associated with its activity.

# CGD Group's self-assessment report 

The structure and contents of the group's report were in line with the provisions of article 58 of the notice and article 4 of the Bank of Portugal's instruction no. 18/2020.

The separate self-assessment reports on CGD and its eligible subsidiaries under the notice, were produced with reference to 30 November 2022. They include the annual reports of the officers responsible for the risk management, compliance and internal audit functions and were respectively prepared in accordance with sub-paragraph s) of no. 1 of article 27, sub-paragraph p) of no. 1 of article 28, and d) no. 1 of article 32, in which no constraints on the level of independence of functions have been reported.

In compliance with the provisions of sub-paragraph a) of no. 1 of article 58.1 of the notice, CGD's board of directors has stated, in its self-assessment report that, in view of the activities undertaken, improvements made, known results, namely the relevant reduction in the number and severity of deficiencies, greater conformity with the established implementation deadlines, improvement of the deficiency management framework, as reflected in the review of the deficiency management policy, lower exposure to entity risk and greater alignment of entities with the group's internal control objectives, that it considers, without prejudice to the referred to limitations, with a reasonable level of security, that the current internal control systems are globally adequate to the nature and magnitude of the risks associated with the group's activity and that significant improvements leading to the effectiveness necessary for its development have been implemented.

The board of directors has also pointed out that, in accordance with sub-paragraph c) of article 57 of the notice, it has continued to implement a set of initiatives to ensure the resolution of the group's internal control deficiencies, namely:

- A review of the deficiencies management policy in July 2022, which, inter alia, enhanced the clarity of the risk level of internal control deficiencies;
- The formalisation of a validation framework for the resolving of deficiencies by the second line of defence, reinforcing its participation in this validation and helping to improve the efficiency of the internal control system;
- The requirement for a more rigorous approach by the structural bodies responsible for resolving the deficiencies, in the definition of action plans and compliance with deadlines; and
- Maintenance of the KPIs associated with the resolution of deficiencies in the balanced scorecard of CGD's and CGD group's structural bodies and entities, making it possible to improve the alignment of all areas of the bank and group entities with the objectives of reducing the number of deficiencies and meeting the deadlines for their resolution.

On 19 December 2022, CGD's DAI delivered the report referred to in sub-paragraph c) of no. 1 of article 32 of the notice to CAUD, providing its global assessment of CGD's organisational culture and its governance and internal control systems. Specifically as regards the group's internal control system, CGD's DAI highlighted the issuance or revision of the corporate standards related to various matters having impacts on the organisational culture and/or governance and internal control systems.

CAUD also took note of the "Opinion of the internal audit function on the self-assessment report on the adequacy and effectiveness of the organisational culture and governance and internal control systems of Caixa Geral de Depósitos, S.A. - Caixa Geral de Depósitos group (Declaration of Conformity)" issued on 19 December 2022. This report was issued under the terms of liability governing the certification of the board of directors' self-assessment report pursuant to the notice, as attributed in the internal control deficiencies management policy, with the objective of verifying the document's conformity with the requirements of the notice and the adequacy of the process for its preparation ensuring that its basic information is complete and represents the "real situation" of the internal control deficiencies database. DAI concludes that the report complies with the existing regulatory provisions in materially relevant aspects and reflects the deficiencies recorded in the group's internal control deficiencies database.

CAUD has stated, in its evaluation report, produced under the terms of sub-paragraphs b) and c) of no. 1 of article 58 of the notice that, based on its oversight activities and analysis of the documentation, it considers that CGD's management and administration bodies have been implementing structural changes to ensure the improvement of the Group's internal control system.

Reference should be made to the following as regards the main operating priorities aimed at strengthening the Group's internal control system:

- The continued implementation of the initiatives of the strategic plans for CGD's control functions and structuring projects on a level of information systems and data quality, which includes the group's perspective in relation to certain aspects;

- Continued endeavours to boost the implementation of corrective measures on the deficiencies (from past years and new deficiencies), closely controlled by the second line of defence and regular reporting as provided for in the governance model set out in the internal control deficiencies management policy;
- In the framework of the 2021 supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP), the ECB, as one of its main concerns in the current adverse economic environment, expressed the need for the prompt supply of sound, robust data, having highlighted the identification of data quality issues essentially resulting from the failure to fully integrate information reporting systems on a group level, which translates into difficulties in capturing and aggregating relevant data for global risk management purposes. In this context, it should be noted that CGD's board of directors has demonstrated its commitment to strengthening the quality of obtaining, producing and processing CGD data, with special reference being made to the plan for compliance with BCBS 239 principles, approved in 2019, to be implemented over a four year period. The implementation of this plan, as part of CGD's strategic IT plan, is certified quarterly and information on its evolution submitted to the board of directors.

To form its opinion, CAUD considered the current and potential impacts of unresolved high-risk deficiencies in CGD group and in view of the above, based on the known results deriving from the activities performed and bearing in mind the improvements made, subject to the limitation arising from the failure to perform independent assessments by an external entity under the terms of the notice and without prejudice to any impacts of (i) the deficiencies identified in the board of directors' assessment report; (ii) the deficiencies also identified in the SREP 2022 Decision; and (iii) the above-referred to inherent limitations, CAUD considers, with a reasonable level of certainty, that the group's current internal control system is, in materially relevant respects, globally adequate and effective for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the requirements set out in article 51 of the notice and that the internal control systems of the subsidiaries and CGD's own internal control system are materially consistent.

The supervisory board has also taken note of the internal audit function's annual report as provided for in sub-paragraph c) of no. 1 of article 32 of the notice, issued on 20 December 2021, in which DAI provides several analyses on the deficiencies existing in CGD and concludes that: "The dynamics of resolving internal control deficiencies, all of which comprising action plans with associated risk mitigation measures and knowledge of the diverse internal governance structures, in addition to the diverse ongoing projects listed in this report show that CGD continues to operationalise the institution's control mechanisms and its procedures and processes leading to the progressive strengthening of the organisational culture and governance and internal control systems".

Reference should, lastly, be made to the fact that the board of directors stated, in its assessment, that it will continue to focus its attention on all opportunities for the improvement of the internal control system and other matters referred to in the notice and will persist, with commitment and determination, in implementing the necessary developments and, in particular, strengthening the group's internal governance and risk culture.
