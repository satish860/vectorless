## LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN

Dear fellow Shareholders,
With a clear focus on uranium and copper for a clean energy future, ENRG Elements has had a significant year of achieving milestones, as we have continued to advance our portfolio of projects in Niger, Botswana and our joint venture in Australia.

Over the past months, we have seen the global demand for carbon neutral energy continue to build and the thematic for uranium has never been stronger, as the world continues to shift towards nuclear power with countries globally striving to meet ambitious net zero carbon emission targets.

The nuclear renaissance continues to build momentum and in August 2022 alone, we have seen further commitments to nuclear power from countries globally.

Importantly, Japan recently reaffirmed its commitment to nuclear power for the first time since Fukushima ${ }^{1}$, with the country planning to accelerate the restart of reactors and signalling the construction of new plants, which represents a monumental shift in the global sentiment towards nuclear energy, with many more countries expected to follow.

Another Asian nation joining the nuclear shift is India recently announcing plans to develop two new nuclear power plants, as the country aims to shift from its reliance on coal power ${ }^{2}$. India is currently building six gigawatts of nuclear capacity, the most after China, which has nearly three times that volume under construction, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

Japan and India represent just two of the many countries globally that continue to join the rapid momentum driven by the nuclear power renaissance.

Africa too is now exploring nuclear energy as a climate friendly way to ease power shortfalls, with at least an additional 10 African countries considering nuclear power as of $2018^{3}$.

To capitalise on this nuclear shift, since acquiring the Agadez Uranium Project in the highly prospective Tim Mersoi Basin of Niger, we have continued to advance our Project with the drilling program nearing completion, and initial results announced in August 2022, further confirming Agadez as highly prospective for uranium.

Guiding this exploration is the recently acquired historical exploration data on the Project, which, when combined with the current results from the Company's own exploration, will result in an improved geological understanding of Agadez, enabling us to further refine our exploration strategy for the project.

Over the coming periods, we will continue exploration at Agadez with the results from the current drilling expected to enable an update to the existing Inferred JORC Resource.

In Botswana, we have continued to advance the Ghanzi West Copper-Silver Project in the Kalahari Copper Belt, with the commencement of an airborne electromagnetic and gravity survey over the Kara dome assets, with the aim of further identifying areas which are favourable for hosting significant economic mineralisation.

The Kalahari Copper Belt represents a significant opportunity for the Company and its shareholders, with exciting copper discoveries reported by other companies in the area over the past months, with the Kara target also located in the same structural zone as Sandfire's globally significant Motheo and A4 copper-silver projects.

Copper remains an important commodity for a clean energy future, as an important metal for the electrification of vehicles, with the medium to long term demand for copper remaining strong.

In October 2021, the Company appointed Ms Caroline Keats as Managing Director, a legally qualified, strategically focused business leader who has since driven ENRG Elements forwards, applying her in depth experience operating in Africa.

Our Company recently changed its name to ENRG Elements Limited and its ASX Ticker Code to ASX: EEL, better reflecting the strategic direction of the Company, as we continue to focus on the exploration and development of our Uranium and Copper projects, both commodities which are critical for a carbon neutral energy system and the electrification of transport.

With the new ENRG Elements name and brand, we have continued to market the Company to both Australian and international investors, generating further interest in our exciting portfolio of assets.

## LETTER FROM THE MANAGING DIRECTOR

Dear Shareholders,

## Overview

I would like to thank all of our shareholders for the ongoing support of ENRG Elements (the Company) over the past twelve months. This year has been a critical juncture for the Company with numerous developments including: completion of acquisition of the Agadez Uranium Project (Agadez Project); activities at Agadez that included a review of historical information, upgrade of the previous Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate to JORC 2012, and exploration program consisting of 5,500m drilling, logging, and a surface sampling campaign; commencement of an electromagnetic and gravity survey at the Ghanzi West Copper-Silver Project (Ghanzi West Project); and review of the Horseshoe West Copper-Gold Project (Horseshoe West Project). In addition to our exploration activities, the Company successfully raised A\$3.0m in June 2022 via a placement that was supported by new domestic and international institutions as well as existing shareholders. Importantly, during the period, the Board underwent a number of changes to better align its composition with the Company's future plans. Lastly, following Shareholder approval, the Company also changed its' name from Kopore Metals Limited to ENRG Elements Limited - to better reflect the focus on future-facing commodities. In summary, the refreshed Company is well-positioned for success as we continue to deliver shareholder value through the exploration of uranium and copper, whilst advancing ENRG Elements to be a leader in commodities for a carbon neutral and electric future.

## Background

The past few months have highlighted the global need for carbon neutral energy. The thematic for uranium has never been stronger - as the world continues to shift towards nuclear power with countries striving to meet ambitious net zero carbon emission targets. The nuclear renaissance continues to build momentum and in August 2022 alone, we have seen further commitments to nuclear power from countries globally.

Recently, the European Union put forward a proposal to make nuclear and uranium a green investment. This is set to be implemented by the end of 2022, with nuclear power being viewed as a core building block to provide net zero carbon emissions and ensure energy security within Europe.

In the US, over $50 \%$ of carbon free power is generated from nuclear ${ }^{4}$, with the Biden Administration recently committing to a US $\$ 6$ billion nuclear power credit program to prevent nuclear reactors from shutting down as part of the country's goal of transitioning to clean energy. ${ }^{5}$

In Asia, China has committed to spending US $\$ 440$ bn on at least 150 new reactors over the next fifteen years - more than the amount built by the rest of the world in the past thirty-five years ${ }^{6}$. Japan has also announced their intentions to restart four nuclear reactors by winter ${ }^{7}$. Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore are also now considering nuclear power.

## Agadez Uranium Project

With uranium and nuclear power continuing to gain momentum as the world shifts towards a carbon neutral energy system, we are well positioned with Agadez to capitalise on growing demand for nuclear fuels.

Following the 100\% acquisition of Agadez, the Company also acquired the project's historical exploration data from Paladin Energy Limited in March 2022. A review of this previously unannounced historical drilling data confirmed Agadez as prospective for uranium, with identified anomalous uranium grades in prospective geology. This data was used to inform the Company's subsequent exploration program.

On 30 May 2022, the Company also announced an upgrade to the historic JORC 2004 Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) at Takardeit for compliance with JORC 2012 compliant Inferred MRE. The Takardeit Deposit contains a JORC 2012 Inferred MRE of 16.5 Mt at a grade of $295 \mathrm{ppm} \mathrm{eU}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{8}$ for 10.7 Mlbs contained $\mathrm{eU}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{8}$ (at 150 ppm cut-off).

In the same month as the MRE update, the Company commenced an initial exploration program following review of the historic exploration data. The program consisted of a drilling program totalling 5,500m, comprising approximately 5,340m of rotary mud drilling and 160 meters of diamond core, plus a detailed logging and surface sampling program. On 1 September 2022, we announced encouraging results from the initial, shallow drill program at the Agadez, with key downhole gamma results including 2 m at $2,266 \mathrm{ppm} \mathrm{eU}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{8}$ from $22.7 \mathrm{~m}, 2 \mathrm{~m}$ at $1,562 \mathrm{ppm} \mathrm{eU}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{8}$ from 28.2 m and 2 m at $1,172 \mathrm{ppm} \mathrm{eU}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{8}$ from 24.7 m . These initial results, that were released post the end of FY22, provide further confirmation that Agadez is highly prospective for uranium, with the Takardeit Deposit remaining open in multiple directions and at depth.

The review of the historic exploration data and our initial exploration program has allowed us to significantly improve our geological understanding of Agadez. This expanded dataset allows us to execute a more targeted exploration program requiring less time and capital. With a clearly defined exploration program, we aim to develop this high potential asset further and continue to capitalise on the growing demand for nuclear energy.

# Ghanzi West Copper-Silver Project 

In Botswana, the Company has continued to advance Ghanzi West, located in the highly prospective Kalahari Copper Belt. An airborne electromagnetic and gravity survey was commenced in August 2022. The survey is focused on the Kara Dome target, located in the same structural zone as Sandfire Resources' globally significant Motheo and A4 copper-silver projects and in the same region as Cobre's recent Ngami copper discovery. Kara Dome is located in favourable stratigraphy between Sandfire's existing deposits to the northeast, and their new licences in Namibia to the northwest. Rio Tinto also has extensive exploration licences in Namibia, further highlighting regional prospectivity.

The Kalahari Copper Belt represents a significant opportunity for the Company and its shareholders, with exciting copper discoveries in the area over the past months. We expect the results from the airborne electromagnetic and gravity survey at Ghanzi to further increase our understanding of the geology at the Kara Dome, thereby guiding further exploration at this high potential project.

## Horseshoe West Copper-Gold Project

In Australia, at our Horseshoe West Copper-Gold Project, in August 2022 we announced the completion of a Dipole-Dipole Induced Polarisation (DDIP) survey that identified new targets. We are currently assessing our exploration strategy on this ground.

## Going Forward

Over the coming period, we aim to continue to create further shareholder value:
Agadez Uranium Project - Developing the project through confirming and extending the existing uranium resource and targeting other areas for further exploration.
Ghanzi West Copper-Silver Project - Identifying drill targets for an upcoming drill campaign through the airborne electromagnetic and gravity survey.
Horseshoe West Gold Project - Conduct a review of the Project to identify potential opportunities.

## Corporate

In late 2021 and early 2022, the Board was refreshed, with the appointment of high-calibre Directors James Eggins and Quinton de Klerk, both of whose experience and skill sets are closely aligned with the Company's forward plans and direction.

In June 2022, the Company successfully completed a A\$3.0 million share placement (before costs), which included a cornerstone investment by Kevin Bambrough, former President of Sprott Inc and CEO of Sprott Resources Corporation. The capital raising was supported by existing shareholders, and we welcomed new domestic and institutional investors to our shareholder register. The commitment to the Company from investors of this calibre is a strong testament to the potential of our projects.

August 2022 saw our Company change its name to ENRG Elements and its ticker code to ASX: EEL to better reflect the strategic direction of the Company, as we continue to focus on the exploration and development of our uranium and copper projects commodities which are critical for a carbon neutral energy system.

With the new ENRG Elements name and brand, we have continued to market the Company to both Australian and international investors, generating further interest in our exciting portfolio of assets.

## Conclusion

On behalf of the Board of ENRG Elements Limited I would like to thank you for your ongoing support to date.
We look forward to an exciting 2023 Financial Year, as we continue to build shareholder value through the exploration of uranium and copper, and as we advance ENRG Elements to be a leader in commodities for a carbon free and electric future.

Yours faithfully,

## Caroline Keats

ANNUAL REPORT 30 JUNE 2022

## OPERATIONS REVIEW 2022

ENRG Elements Limited (formerly known as Kopore Metals Limited) (ASX: EEL) (ENRG or the Company) is pleased to present its review of operations for the financial year ended 30 June 2022 (FY22).

Key activities and achievements for FY22 are summarised below.

## Agadez Project, Niger Acquisition of Agadez Project

On 9 December 2021, the Company announced it had entered into a binding share sale agreement with Endeavour Financial AG (Endeavour) to acquire 100\% of Endeavour's uranium project in the Agadez region of Niger (Agadez Project) (Transaction).

The Agadez Project comprises three (3) granted exploration permits (Permits) (Targets) and one (1) exploration licence application in the highly prospective Tim Mersoi Basin, considered one of the world's major uranium producing areas. The Permits host the same geology that is represented at Orano's Cominak (now shut down), Somair and Imouraren mines and the Madaouela (Goviex) and Dasa (Global Atomic) projects. According to the World Nuclear Association, Niger was the 7th largest producer of uranium in 2021 and has been an exporter of uranium since the early 1970's.

The Company agreed to purchase 100\% of the issued capital in EF Niger Exploration SARL (EF Niger), the wholly owned subsidiary of Endeavour that held the Niger Agadez Project Permits (Agreement). In consideration, the Company paid US\$100,000 to Endeavour (as reimbursement for historic shareholder loans) and issued Endeavour (or its nominees) 120,000,000 Company shares at a deemed issued price of $\$ 0.02$ (Consideration Shares). These Consideration Shares were subject to a cascading voluntary escrow regime, with shares escrowed for 3, 6 and 12 months. The Agreement contains orderly sales provisions in relation to the sale of the Consideration Shares.

Under the terms of the Transaction, the Company agreed to spend a minimum of US\$2,000,000 on the Permits within the first 24 months (subject to any force majeure extension), with US\$1,500,000 of that amount to be spent on a drilling program. This obligation falls away if the Company declares a Mineral Resource of at least 16Mlb of $\mathrm{U}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{8}$ at a minimum grade of $200 \mathrm{ppm} \mathrm{U}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{8}$ on any of the Permits (prepared and reported in accordance with the JORC Code).

The Company issued Endeavour (or its nominees) 80,000,000 performance shares with a 5-year expiry date, and 50,000,000 performance options with an exercise price of $\$ 0.03$ and a 3-year expiry date, with the vesting of those performance shares and options linked to the Target having declared a Mineral Resource of at least 16 Mlb of $\mathrm{U}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{8}$ at a minimum grade of $200 \mathrm{ppm} \mathrm{U}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{8}$ on any of the permits.

Completion of the Transaction was conditional upon:

- the Company raising at least A\$1,000,000 (before costs);
- the Company being satisfied around its due diligence on the Target and the Agadez Project;
- the Target obtaining a 2-year extension on the Agadez Project permits (on terms satisfactory to it) taking the Permit term to November 2024;
- the Company obtaining all necessary regulatory, government and shareholder approvals in respect of the Transaction; and
- the Target terminating certain contracts.

On the 24 May 2022, following the conditions of the Transaction being achieved, ENRG Elements announced the completion of the 100\% acquisition of the Agadez Project in Niger.

## Historical Exploration Review and Resource Update

The Company announced on 14 March 2022 that it had acquired historical data on the Agadez Project, which included geological and geophysical information, surveys, photographs, drill logs and assay results from Paladin Energy Limited (Paladin).

This acquisition of the historical data enabled ENRG Elements to validate the historically reported information and utilise the data to inform and guide upcoming exploration.

On 7 April 2022, the Company confirmed the Agadez Project as prospective for uranium, following the completion of a review of historical exploration information and results from the previously unannounced drilling program completed by Paladin in 2011. The review by the Company's technical consultants identified mineralisation across the permits, recognised the potential for higher-grade areas of mineralisation within the Takardeit Inferred Mineral Resource (originally under JORC 2004) and enabled the prioritisation of key exploration targets at the Agadez Project.

Historical exploration on the tenements was completed by NGM Resources Limited (previous owners), who published a JORC 2004 Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate in 2010 for the Takardeit deposit (ASX Release - 9 December 2021). The Company undertook a process of updating this Mineral Resource Estimate to comply with JORC 2012 Guidelines with the Takardeit deposit now holding 16.5Mt at a grade of $295 \mathrm{ppm} \mathrm{eU}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{8}$ for 10.7 Mlbs , in the Inferred category (ASX Release - 30 May 2022).

# Drilling Program in Niger 

In May 2022, the Company announced an exploration program at the Agadez Project, which commenced in June 2022. The program consisted of both a drilling campaign as well as logging and surface sampling, with drilling for a total of $5,500 \mathrm{~m}$ including approximately $5,340 \mathrm{~m}$ of rotary mud drilling and 160 m of diamond core.

The program aimed to confirm and extend uranium mineralisation previously delineated within Jurassic formations (Tchirezrine I and Mousseden) in the Takardeit prospect (NGM Resources Limited's historical resource area). The drill and surface sampling program completed on 1 September 2022, with preliminary downhole gamma results expected shortly after completion of the program and assay results due in Q4 CY2022.

## Virgo Project and Ghazi West Copper-Silver Project, Botswana

## Sale of 75\% of Virgo Project

On 11 November 2021, the Company announced completion of the sale of $75 \%$ of the issued capital in its wholly owned subsidiary, Alvis-Crest (Proprietary) Limited (Alvis), to ARC Minerals Limited (ARC). The transaction was first announced on 25 March 2021. 35,488,259 fully paid ordinary shares in ARC, based upon a 10-day VWAP of 3.3814 pence per share for a total consideration value of $£ 1.2$ million (approx. A $\$ 2.2$ million), were issued to the Company and subject to customary orderly sale provisions. As at 30 June 2022, the Company had sold all of the ARC shares for consideration of approximately A\$2.14 million (before costs).

ARC retains an option to acquire the remaining $25 \%$ of Alvis for consideration of US $\$ 5$ million. The option is valid until ARC reaches a Final Investment Decision (FID) is reached by ARC and the option consideration is payable in cash or ARC Shares (or a combination of the two) at the election of ARC. ARC is responsible for sole funding Alvis up to FID, ensuring the Company's remaining $25 \%$ interest in Alvis is not diluted during this period, and will spend an average of a minimum of US $\$ 200,000$ per year on exploration drilling and resources definition on the licences over any rolling three-year period prior to FID.

The Company will receive a $1 \%$ net smelter royalty over the Virgo Project, capped at a maximum of US $\$ 30$ million. ARC has the option to purchase the royalty for US $\$ 5$ million at any time up to FID, on the terms included in the royalty agreement.

## Ghazi West Copper-Silver Project

On 15 November 2021, the Company advised that three of its Botswana prospecting licenses for PL203/2016, PL204/2016 and PL205/2016 had been renewed for a further two years. On 26 July 2022 ENRG advised it had received prospecting license renewals for a further two years for PL127/2017, PL128/2017 and PL129/2017 from the Botswana Ministry of Mineral Resources, Green Technology and Energy Security. These prospecting licenses cover the Company's high priority Kara Dome target and the Korong Dome prospect.

A desktop review of the historical work on this Project area, including the results of the in progress airborne electromagnetic and gravity survey, will inform the future drilling program.

## Horseshoe West Project

## Earn in and Joint Venture Agreement

In January 2021, the Company announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Kopore (WA) Pty Ltd, had entered into binding earnin and joint venture agreement (Agreement) with Murchison Copper Mines Pty Ltd (MCM), a subsidiary of Horseshoe Metals Limited (ASX:HOR) (HML), providing for an earn in and joint venture in relation to the tenements surrounding the historical Horseshoe Lights Copper-Gold Mine (Horseshoe Project).

The Horseshoe Project area totals 32.4 km 2 and comprises 1 exploration licence, 9 prospecting licences and part of 1 mining lease (MS2/743). The Horseshoe Project is located immediately west of the Horseshoe Lights Copper-Gold Mine and 140km north of Meekatharra, Western Australia. On 17 November 2021, the Company announced it had received confirmation from HML that the 9 prospecting licenses had received a four-year extension of term. HML also advised the Company that mining lease ML52/743, where the Horseshoe Lights Mine is situated, had been renewed for a further 21 years.

Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company is required to spend $\$ 1.45$ million on exploration to earn a $51 \%$ beneficial interest in the project area over a two-year period. This includes a minimum expenditure amount of $\$ 250,000$ to be spent in year 1. Upon completion of this stage, ENRG and MCM will form an unincorporated joint venture in relation to the exploration of the agreement area. The parties' initial respective interest in the Joint Venture will be ENRG $51 \%$ and MCM $49 \%$.

ENRG can then elect to expend an additional $\$ 1.5$ million within a further 2 years to earn into an additional $19 \%$ beneficial interest over the Horseshoe Project area. If ENRG completes the stage 2 earn in, the parties' respective interest in the Joint Venture will be ENRG $70 \%$ and MCM $30 \%$. Following the earn-in, the parties must each contribute to Joint Venture expenses in proportion to their respective percentage.

In February 2022, the Company advised of a variation to the Agreement such that the initial expenditure of $\$ 1.45$ million to earn a $51 \%$ beneficial interest must be expended by 30 June 2023 (previously 17 February 2023), unless otherwise extended. In

ANNUAL REPORT 30 JUNE 2022

February 2022 the Company also announced that it had successfully achieved the first-year minimum expenditure milestone under the Agreement.

## Exploration

ENRG is investigating the Horseshoe Project area for potential Horseshoe Lights style copper-gold and shear-zone hosted gold mineralisation exploration targets.

Following the completion of an airborne magnetic survey over the Horseshoe Project area, where several priority targets were highlighted (ASX Release - 29 July 2021), an auger program was designed to investigate the magnetic trends and test for potential shallow anomalous copper-gold mineralisation. ENRG completed the soil sampling program across an area of approximately 2.9 km 2 , partially covering $\mathrm{P} 52 / 1443, \mathrm{P} 52 / 1544, \mathrm{E} 52 / 3759$ and ML52/743 and at a $100 \times 60 \mathrm{~m}$ grid spacing. A total of 451 auger samples were collected for a total of 270 m , down to drill refusal and a maximum of 2.5 metres. In November 2021 the Company announced the delineation of a coherent copper-gold soil anomaly in a largely unexplored area of the Horseshoe Project.

A Dipole-Dipole Induced Polarisation (DDIP) survey was then designed at the Horseshoe Project to investigate both historic and recent copper-gold geochemical and geophysical anomalies for signs of chargeability anomalies that could indicate sulphide minerals at depth to target reverse circulation or diamond drilling. Six DDIP survey lines were acquired along the western margin of the project licences. The DDIP interpretation highlighted several priority chargeable targets for sulphide minerals related to VMS or lode-gold styles of mineralisation (ASX Release - 16 August 2022). The Company is now in the process of reviewing all the existing information on the Horseshoe Project and assessing how to best advance the project.

## Corporate

## Board Changes

During the period ending 30 June 2022, the Company underwent several corporate developments, most notably with the appointment of Ms Caroline Keats as Managing Director on a full-time basis. Ms Keats was initially appointed as a Non-Executive Director on 5 August 2021. Mr Simon Jackson stepped down as Managing Director upon Ms Keats' appointment on 4 October 2021 and continued in a part-time executive role for six months.

On 15 November 2021, Mr James Eggins was appointed as Non-Executive Chairman and Mr Peter Meagher and Mr Simon Jackson resigned as Non-Executive Chairman and Non-Executive Director respectively.

On 17 January 2022, the Company announced the appointment of Mr Quinton de Klerk as a Non-Executive Director and the resignation of Mr Grant Ferguson as a Non-Executive Director of the Company.

## Capital Raisings

On 17 December 2021 the Company raised A\$1.2 million (before costs) through a placement of 40 million shares at an issue price of $A \$ 0.03$ per share. The funds raised were used to fund the Niger Transaction and for working capital.

ENRG announced the completion of a further successful capital raising for $\$ 3.0$ million (before costs) on 3 June 2022, to fund the exploration and development of the Company's portfolio of assets, in particular the Agadez Project, and for general working capital purposes (Placement). 89,393,939 fully paid ordinary shares were issued at $\$ 0.033$ per Share pursuant to the Placement. A further 1,515,151 fully paid ordinary shares were subject to shareholder approval which was obtained subsequent to the period, on 28 July 2022 pursuant to ASX Listing Rule 10.11. The Placement was strongly supported by existing shareholders and incoming investors, including domestic and offshore institutional investors with a cornerstone investment from Kevin Bambrough, former President of Sprott Inc and CEO of Sprott Resources Corporation. Funds are being deployed toward exploration of the Agadez Project, Ghazi West Copper-Silver Project and working Capital.

The Company's cash balance as at 30 June 2022 was $\$ 4,148,000$.

## Subsequent to the End of The Period

Subsequent to the end of the period:

1. Following shareholder approval at the meeting held on 28 July 2022, the Company changed its name from Kopore Metals Limited to ENRG Elements Limited, with the Company's shares registered for trading under the new ticker code ASX:EEL on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). The new name reflects the Company's strategy and focus of developing its uranium and copper projects supporting a carbon neutral and electric future.
2. The Company appointed NRG Exploration CC in July 2022 to conduct an airborne electromagnetic and gravity survey, commencing in August 2022, across the Kara Dome asset at the Company's Ghanzi West Copper-Silver Project in Botswana (ASX Release - 12 July 2022). The program is focused on identifying fold related anticline hinge zones and structurally controlled trap sites associated with domal structures, similar to those discovered along strike by Sandfire Resources (Motheo and A4 copper-silver projects), with results from the program expected in Q4 CY2022.

3. On 1 September 2022, the Company advised the market that the shallow drill program at the Agadez Project delivered encouraging drill results. The $\sim 5,500$ mud rotary and diamond drilling program commenced in June 2022 shortly after the Company completed the acquisition of the Agadez Project. The campaign confirmed that mineralisation, occurring from surface to $\sim 40 \mathrm{~m}$, extends beyond the current Mineral Resource Estimate at Takardeit and is open in multiple directions. Significant downhole gamma result at Takardeit Centre included:

- KMP0048 - 2m at 2,266 eU $_{2} \mathrm{O}_{8}$ from 22.7 m ;
- KMP0030 - 2m at 1,562 eU $_{2} \mathrm{O}_{8}$ from 28.2 m ; and
- KMP0018 - 2m at 1,172 eU $_{2} \mathrm{O}_{8}$ from 24.7 m ;

The Company anticipates an update to the Takardeit Mineral Resource Estimate, following receipt of assay results, which are expected in Q4 CY 2022.

# Annual Mineral Resource and Ore Reserves Statement 

On 24 May 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of the Agadez Uranium Project in Niger. At the time of completion, an Inferred Mineral Resource had been estimated under the JORC 2004 guidelines for the Takardeit Deposit (see ASX announcement dated 9 December 2021).

Following the acquisition, the Company updated the Inferred Mineral Resource for the Takardeit Deposit in accordance with the JORC 2012 guidelines. The updated Mineral Resource was disclosed to ASX on 30 May 2022.

The Company confirms that it is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the Mineral Resource as reported on 30 May 2022 and all material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the estimates in the relevant market announcement continue to apply and have not materially changed.

The Company carries out an annual review of its Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, as required by the ASX Listing Rules. The review was carried out as at 30 June 2022.

Takardeit Inferred Mineral Resources as at 30 June 2022

| Mineral Resource | Cut off | M Tonnes | Grade ppm eU $_{2} \mathrm{O}_{8}$ | Mlb eU $_{2} \mathrm{O}_{8}$ |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Update (JORC 2012) | 150 | 16.5 | 295 | 10.7 |

Comparison to previous Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate

| Mineral Resource | Cut off | M Tonnes | Grade ppm eU $_{2} \mathrm{O}_{8}$ | Mlb eU $_{2} \mathrm{O}_{8}$ |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Historical (JORC 2004) | 120 | 23.2 | 210 | 10.9 |

The updated Mineral Resource has been reported above a cut-off grade of 150ppm eU3O8 reflecting estimated processing costs and recoveries as well as projected product pricing. The updated Mineral Resource reflects an increase in grade of $39 \%$ with a corresponding reduction in tonnes primarily due to the exclusion of internal sub-grade material from the previous mineralisation wireframe and the increase in reporting cut-off grade. The updated Mineral Resource represents a minor decrease in total contained metal.

## Estimation Governance Statement

The Company ensures that all Mineral Resource and Ore Reserves estimations are subject to appropriate levels of governance and internal controls.

Exploration results are collected and managed by an independent competent qualified geologist. All data collection activities are conducted to industry standards based on a framework of quality assurance and quality control protocols covering all aspects of sample collection, topographical and geophysical surveys, drilling, sample preparation, physical and chemical analysis and data and sample management.

Mineral Resource and Ore Reserves estimates are prepared by appropriately qualified, independent Competent Persons. If there is a material change in the estimate of a Mineral Resource or Ore Reserves, the estimate and supporting documentation in question is reviewed by a suitable qualified independent Competent Persons and announced to the ASX in accordance with the Listing Rules.

The Company reports its Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves on an annual basis in accordance with JORC Code 2012.

# DIRECTORS' REPORT 

## 9. FINANCIAL POSITION

The net assets of the Group have increased from 30 June 2021 by $\$ 4,139,638$ to $\$ 4,722,209$ at 30 June 2022 (2021: \$582,571).
As at 30 June 2022, the Group's cash and cash equivalents increased from 30 June 2021 by $\$ 3,595,197$ to $\$ 4,148,992$ at 30 June 2022 (2021: \$553,795) and had working capital of $\$ 4,045,033$ (2021: \$499,566), as noted in Note 9.

The Directors believe the Group is in a satisfactorily stable financial position to continue its current operations.

## 10. KEY BUSINESS RISKS

The Group is subject to various risk factors. Some of these are specific to its business activities while others are of a more general nature. Individually, or in combination, these risk factors may affect the future operating and financial performance of the Group.

## a. OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY RISKS

The Company seeks to ensure that it provides a safe workplace to minimise risk of harm to its employees and contractors. It achieves this through an appropriate safety culture, safety systems, training, and emergency preparedness.

## b. EXPLORATION RISK

Exploration and Mineral Resource development incorporates a high degree of technical and geological risk. The natural endowment of the ground being explored is the limiting factor and there always remains a risk of insufficient natural endowment to make an economic discovery.

Detailed planning of exploration programs, with external consultant input where required, ensures the highest quality exploration targets are tested. The Board approves all exploration programs and budgets to achieve outcomes in the Company's (and shareholders) best interests, with regular reporting provided to the Board of the results of exploration programs.

The Company undertakes business development activities to source new projects for the Company with the objective of acquiring assets with a high potential for exploration success.

## c. SUPPLIER RISK

Current economic climate has impacted both the cost and availability of key suppliers (drill contractors, analytical laboratories, labour hire, consultants etc) to allow the Company to conduct exploration activity in a timely manner.

In order to mitigate these risks, the Company:

1. Maintains contact with multiple suppliers for services; and
2. Plans activities ahead of time, taking into account Board approved budget allocations and work programs, to ensure sufficient notice of work can be provided.

## d. MINERAL RESOURCES

The Mineral Resources for the Group's projects are estimates only and no assurance can be given that they will be realised.

## e. GOVERNMENT CHARGES

The Group has assets in multiple jurisdictions namely, Australia, Botswana and Niger. The mining industry is subject to a number of Government taxes, royalties and charges. Changes to the rates of taxes, royalties and charges can impact on the future profitability of the Company. The Company maintains communications with relevant parties to mitigate potential increases.

## f. LOSS OF KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL

The resources sector is currently highly competitive with significant cost escalation and wage growth. The loss of key management personnel would impact the Company's ability to undertake activities in a timely manner.

The Board maintains regular contact with the Company's Executive and other personnel to ensure the Board is fully informed of all material business issues. The Company undertakes annual reviews for key roles to ensure competitive contracts are in place and has contractual notice periods in place to minimise business disruption.

# DIRECTORS' REPORT 

## g. ENVIRONMENTAL

The Group has environmental liabilities associated with its tenements which arise as a consequence of its operations. The Group monitors its ongoing environmental obligations and risks and implements rehabilitation and corrective actions as appropriate.
h. COVID-19

The Group continues to consider the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business. Throughout 2022, the Group has continued to manage the risk that COVID-19 poses to the health and safety of its workforce across all jurisdictions that it operates in. The Group follows government guidelines with respect to managing COVID-19 and the impacts on the Group's employees and contractors.
i. MARKET RISK

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.

The Group is exposed to movements in market interest rates on short term deposits. The policy is to monitor the interest rate yield curve out to 120 days to ensure a balance is maintained between the liquidity of cash assets and the interest rate return. The Group does not have short or long-term debt, and therefore this risk is minimal.

## j. COMMUNITY/SOCIAL RISKS

The Group operates in different jurisdictions with varying community, heritage and social laws and cultural practices. Community expectations are continually evolving and are managed through the development of robust strategies, maintaining strong relationships with communities and delivering on its commitments.

## k. FINANCIAL RISKS

The Group recognises the importance of maintaining a strong balance sheet that enables flexibility to pursue strategic objectives. ENRG maintains policies which define appropriate financial controls and governance which seek to ensure financial risks are recognised, managed and recorded in a manner consistent with generally accepted industry practice and governance standards.

## I. REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISK

New or evolving regulations and international standards are outside the Company's control and are often complex and difficult to predict. The potential development of international opportunities can be jeopardised by changes to fiscal or regulatory regimes, adverse changes to tax laws, difficulties in interpreting or complying with local laws, material differences in sustainability standards and practices, or changes to existing political, judicial or administrative policies and changing community expectations.

## m. ANTI-BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION RISK

The Group's business activities and operations are located in jurisdictions with varying degrees of political and judicial stability, including some countries with a relatively high inherent risk with regards to bribery and corruption. This exposes ENRG to the risk of unauthorised payments or offers of payments to or by employees, agents or distributors that could be in violation of applicable anti-corruption laws.

The Group has a clear Anti-bribery and Corruption Policy, and internal controls and procedures to protect against such risks, including training and compliance programmes for its employees, agents and distributors. However, there is no assurance that such controls, policies, procedures or programmes will protect the Group from potentially improper or criminal acts.

## n. CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT

A rise in nationalist sentiment presents an operational risk to the Group. Sovereign risk associated with changes of government, including coup d'états, can result in sanctions. Fiscal policy changes can materially impact the profitability of the Group.

## 11. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN STATE OF AFFAIRS

There were no other significant changes in the state of affairs of the Group during the year ended 30 June 2022.

## DIRECTORS' REPORT

## 12. EVENTS SUBSEQUENT TO REPORTING DATE

The impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is ongoing and while it has been financially positive for the Group up to 30 June 2022, it is not practicable to estimate the potential impact, positive or negative, after the reporting date. The situation is rapidly developing and is dependent on measures imposed by the Australian Government and other countries, such as maintaining social distancing requirements, quarantine, travel restrictions and any economic stimulus that may be provided.

There were no other events which occurred subsequent to the reporting date that are not covered in this Directors' Report or within the financial statements at Note 16.

## 13. LIKELY DEVELOPMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS

Likely future developments in the operations of the Group are referred to in the Operations Review on page 5 of this Annual Report.

## 14. DIRECTORS' SHAREHOLDINGS, CONTRACTS AND BENEFITS

Since the end of the previous financial year no Director of the Company has received, or became entitled to receive a benefit (other than a benefit included in the aggregate amount of emoluments received or due and receivable by Directors shown in the accounts) by reason of a contract made by the Company with the Director or with a firm of which the Director is a member, or a Company in which the Director has a substantial financial interest, other than as disclosed in the remuneration report below.

# DIRECTORS' REPORT 

## 15. REMUNERATION REPORT (AUDITED)

The full Board currently fulfils the role of a Remuneration Committee in line with a Remuneration Committee Charter and in accordance with the Company's adopted remuneration policy.

### 15.1. REMUNERATION POLICY

This policy governs the operations of the Remuneration Committee. The Committee shall review and reassess the policy at least annually and obtain the approval of the Board.

## a. EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION

The Company's remuneration policy for Executive Directors and senior management is designed to promote superior performance and long-term commitment to the Company. Executive Directors receive a base remuneration which is market related, and may be entitled to performance-based remuneration at the ultimate discretion of the Board.

Overall remuneration policies are subject to the discretion of the Board and can be changed to reflect competitive market and business conditions where it is in the interests of the Company and shareholders to do so.

Executive Directors' remuneration and other terms of employment are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee having regard to performance, relevant comparative information and expert advice.

The Committee's reward policy reflects its obligation to align Executive Directors' remuneration with shareholders' interests and to retain appropriately qualified executive talent for the benefit of the Company. The main principles of the policy are:
(i) reward reflects the competitive market in which the Company operates;
(ii) individual reward should be linked to performance criteria; and
(iii) Executive Directors should be rewarded for both financial and non-financial performance.

The total remuneration of executives and other senior managers consists of the following:
(i) salary - Executive Directors and senior managers receive a sum payable monthly in cash;
(ii) bonus - Executive Directors and nominated senior managers are eligible to participate in a bonus or profit participation plan if deemed appropriate;
(iii) long term incentives - Executive Directors may participate in share option schemes with the prior approval of shareholders. Executives may also participate in employee share option schemes, with any option issues generally being made in accordance with thresholds set in plans approved by shareholders. The Board however, considers it appropriate to retain the flexibility to issue options to executives outside of approved employee option plans in exceptional circumstances; and
(iv) other benefits - Executive Directors and senior managers are eligible to participate in superannuation schemes and other appropriate additional benefits.

Remuneration of other executives consists of the following:
(i) salary - senior executives receive a sum payable monthly in cash;
(ii) bonus - each executive is eligible to participate in a bonus or profit participation plan if deemed appropriate;
(iii) long term incentives - each senior executive may, where appropriate, participate in share option schemes which have been approved by shareholders; and
(iv) other benefits - senior executives are eligible to participate in superannuation schemes and other appropriate additional benefits.

## b. NON-EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION

Shareholders approve the maximum aggregate remuneration for Non-Executive Directors. The full Board recommends the actual payments to Directors and the Board is responsible for ratifying any recommendations, if appropriate. The maximum aggregate remuneration approved for Non-Executive Directors is currently $\$ 300,000$.

It is recognised that Non-Executive Directors' remuneration is ideally structured to exclude equity-based remuneration. However, whilst the Company remains small and the full Board, including the Non-Executive Directors, are included in the operations of the Company more closely than may be the case with larger companies, the Non-Executive Directors are entitled to participate in equity-based remuneration schemes subject to shareholder approval.

All Directors are entitled to have their indemnity insurance paid by the Company.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022

## NOTE 4 INCOME TAX (CONT.)

4.4 Net deferred tax assets have not been brought to account as it is not probable within the immediate future that tax profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised.

The Group has tax losses of $\$ 18,033,720$ (2021: $\$ 11,505,896$ ) that have the ability to be carried forward indefinitely for offset against future taxable profits of the Group. The recoupment of available tax losses as at 30 June 2022 are contingent upon the Group satisfying the following conditions:

- deriving future assessable income of a nature and of an amount sufficient to enable the benefit from the losses to be realised;
- the conditions for deductibility imposed by tax legislation continuing to be complied with and the Company meeting either its continuity of ownership test or in the absence of satisfying that test the Company can satisfy the same business test; and
- there being no changes in tax legislation which would adversely affect the Group from realising the benefits from the losses.

In the event that the Group fails to satisfy these conditions above or the Commissioner of Taxation challenges the Group's ability to utilise its losses, the Group may be liable for future income tax on assessable income derived by the Company.

Balances disclosed in the financial statements and the notes thereto, related to taxation, are based on the best estimates of Directors. These estimates consider both the financial performance and position of the Company as they pertain to current income taxation legislation, and the Directors understanding thereof. No adjustment has been made for pending or future taxation legislation. The current income tax position represents that Directors' best estimate, pending an assessment by tax authorities in relevant jurisdictions.

### 4.5 Accounting Policy

The income tax expense or revenue for the period is the tax payable on the current period's taxable income based on the national income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, and to unused tax losses.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences at the tax rates expected to apply when the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled, based on those tax rates which are enacted or substantively enacted for each jurisdiction. The relevant tax rates are applied to the cumulative amounts of deductible and taxable temporary differences to measure the deferred tax asset or liability. An exception is made for certain temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability. No deferred tax asset or liability is recognised in relation to these temporary differences if they arose in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction did not affect either accounting profit or taxable profit or loss.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of investments in controlled entities where the parent entity is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Current and deferred tax balances attributable to amounts recognised directly in equity are also recognised directly in equity.

5.2.2 The Group's financial instruments consist mainly of deposits with banks, accounts receivables and payables and loans to subsidiaries. Risk exposure arising from current receivables is set out in Note 8. Due to the short-term nature of the current receivables, their carrying amount is assumed to approximate their fair value. 5.2.3 The Group did not recognise any losses in profit or loss in respect of the expected credit losses for the year ended 30 June 2022.

### 5.2.4 Accounting Policy

Other receivables are generally due for settlement within periods ranging from 15 days to 30 days. Receivables expected to be collected within 12 months of the end of the reporting period are classified as current assets. All other receivables are classified as non-current assets.

Other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any allowance for expected credit losses. Allowance for expected credit losses of receivables is continually reviewed and those that are considered to be uncollectible are written off by reducing the carrying amount directly. An allowance account is used when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms. Factors considered by the Group in making this determination include known significant financial difficulties of the debtor, review of financial information and significant delinquency in making contractual payments to the Group. The allowance is set equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the receivable and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. Where receivables are short-term discounting is not applied in determining the allowance. The amount of the allowance for expected credit losses is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income within other expenses. When another receivable for which an allowance had been recognised becomes uncollectible in a subsequent period, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against other expenses in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. 5.3 Other Assets 5.3.1 Current:

### 5.4.2 Accounting Policy

Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are normally settled on 30-day terms. Trade payables and other payables are carried at amortised cost and represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year that are unpaid and arise when the Group becomes obliged to make future payments in respect of the purchase of these goods and services. Trade creditors and other payables are presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due within 12 months. Trade and other payables are classified as financial liabilities. Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

### 5.5 Other Significant Accounting Policies related to Financial Assets and Liabilities

### 5.5.1 Investments and other financial assets

a. Classification

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:

- those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income (OCI) or through profit or loss), and
- those to be measured at amortised cost.

The classification depends on the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows. For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI. For investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the Group has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes. b. Recognition and derecognition

Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade-date, the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. c. Measurement

At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss. Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022

## NOTE 5 FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES (CONT.)

### 5.5 Other Significant Accounting Policies related to Financial Assets and Liabilities (cont.)

i. Debt instruments

Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Group classifies its debt instruments:

- Amortised cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss and presented in other gains/(losses) together with foreign exchange gains and losses. Impairment losses are presented as separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.
- FVOCl: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCl. Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised in other gains/(losses). Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in other gains/(losses) and impairment expenses are presented as separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.
- FVPL: Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCl are measured at FVPL. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVPL is recognised in profit or loss and presented net within other gains/(losses) in the period in which it arises.
ii. Equity instruments

The Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where the Group's management has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investment. Dividends from such investments continue to be recognised in profit or loss as other income when the Group's right to receive payments is established.
Changes in the fair value of financial assets at FVPL are recognised in other gains/(losses) in the statement of profit or loss as applicable. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) on equity investments measured at FVOCl are not reported separately from other changes in fair value.
d. Impairment

The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis, the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost and FVOCl. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.
For trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by AASB 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.

### 6.1.2 Accounting Policy

(a) Recognition and measurement

All plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. (b) Subsequent costs

Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of comprehensive income during the financial period in which they are incurred. (c) Depreciation

Depreciation on plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost or re-valued amounts, net of their residual values, over their estimated useful lives, as follows:

- Furniture, fittings and equipment

5 years

- Motor vehicles

5 years

The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. (d) Derecognition and disposal

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are included in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.

6.2 Mineral Exploration and Evaluation Assets 6.2.1 Non-current:

Balance at the beginning of the year Written off during the year Foreign exchange movements Reclassified as assets held for sales Balance at the end of the financial year 6.2.2 Recoverability of the carrying amount of exploration assets is dependent on the successful exploration of the areas of interest.

### 6.2.3 Key Estimate - Impairment

The Group assesses impairment at each reporting date by evaluating conditions specific to the Group that may lead to impairment of assets and in particular exploration assets. Where an impairment trigger exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined and is dependent upon the ability of the Group to successfully continue exploration of all areas of interest and satisfy the requirements under AASB 6. Specifically, the Company has reviewed its exploration tenements with regard to AASB 6 and have determined that:

- the period for which the Group has the right to explore in the exploration tenements has not expired during the period or will not expire in the near future, and is expected to be renewed;
- substantive expenditure on further exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the exploration tenements is planned;
- exploration will be ongoing for some time and as such it is far too early to state that a discovery of commercially viable quantities of mineral resources has not occurred; and
- as the exploration is still ongoing, there is no sufficient data to conclude that the carrying amount of the exploration and evaluation asset is unlikely to be recovered.

### 6.2.4 Key Judgments - Exploration and evaluation expenditure

Exploration and evaluation costs are carried forward where right of tenure of the area of interest is current. These costs are carried forward in respect of an area that has not at reporting date reached a stage that permits reasonable assessment of the existence of economically recoverable reserves, refer to the accounting policy stated below. The carrying value of capitalised expenditure at reporting date is $\$$ Nil (2021: \$Nil). During the financial year, the Group undertook assessment of its tenement assets. As a result of this assessment, the Group decided that no impairment of its exploration assets was necessary.

### 6.2.5 Accounting Policy

(a) Exploration and evaluation expenditure

Exploration and evaluation project acquisition costs incurred is accumulated in respect of each identifiable area of interest. These costs are only carried forward to the extent that they are expected to be recouped through the successful development of the area or where activities in the area have not yet reached a stage that permits reasonable assessment of the existence of economically recoverable reserves. Ongoing exploration and evaluation expenditures are expensed as incurred. Accumulated costs in relation to an abandoned area are written off in full against profit or loss in the year in which the decision to abandon the area is made. When production commences, the accumulated costs for the relevant area of interest are amortised over the life of the area according to the rate of depletion of the economically recoverable reserves. A regular review is undertaken of each area of interest to determine the appropriateness of continuing to carry forward costs in relation to that area of interest.

6.2.5 Accounting Policy (cont.) (b) Impairment of exploration and evaluation assets

The recoverability of the carrying amount of the exploration and evaluation assets is dependent on successful development and commercial exploitation, or alternatively sale, of the respective area of interest. 6.3 Other Significant Accounting Policies related to Non-Financial Assets and Liabilities 6.3.1 Impairment of non-financial assets

Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.

## SECTION B. RISK

This section of the notes discusses the Group's exposure to various risks and shows how these could affect the Group's financial position and performance.

## NOTE 8 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

### 8.1 Financial Risk Management Policies

The Group's financial instruments consist mainly of deposits with banks, short-term investments, and accounts receivables and payables, loans to subsidiaries. The Group does not speculate in the trading of derivative instruments.
Risk management has focused on limiting liabilities to a level which could be extinguished by sale of assets if necessary.
The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks; market risk (including fair value interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk. The Group's overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group. The Group is engaged in mineral exploration and evaluation, and does not currently sell product and derives only limited revenue from interest earned.
Risk management is carried out by the Board as a whole and no formal risk management policy has been adopted but is in the process of development.
The Group holds the following financial instruments:

## Financial assets

- Cash and cash equivalents
- Other receivables

Financial liabilities

- Trade and other payables

Net financial instruments

| 2022 | 2021 |
| :--: | --: |
| 5 | 5 |
| $4,148,992$ | 553,795 |
| 292,322 | 61,229 |
| $4,441,314$ | 615,024 |
| 396,281 | 115,458 |
| 396,281 | 115,458 |
| $4,045,033$ | 499,566 |

### 8.2 Specific Financial Risk Exposures and Management

### 8.2.1 Market risk

a. Foreign exchange risk

Foreign exchange risk arises from future commitments, assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency of the Group being US dollar (USD), Botswana Pula and West Africa CFA franc (XOF). Currently there are no foreign exchange programs in place. The Group treasury function manages the purchase of foreign currency to meet operational requirements. The impact of reasonably possible changes in foreign exchange rates for the Group has the potential to be material. The Group monitors this risk on a regular basis.
b. Price risk

The Group is not exposed to securities price risk on investments held for trading or for medium to longer term as no such investments are currently held.

### 8.2.2 Credit risk

The maximum exposure to credit risk, excluding the value of any collateral or other security, at reporting date to recognised financial assets, is the carrying amount, net of any provisions for impairment of those assets, as disclosed in the statement of financial position and notes to the financial statements. The Group does not have any material credit risk exposure to any single receivable or group of receivables.
The Group applies simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all receivables and contract assets.
Credit risk related to balances with banks and other financial institutions is managed by the Directors in accordance with approved Company policy.

## NOTE 8 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONT.)

### 8.2 Specific Financial Risk Exposures and Management (cont.)

### 8.2.3 Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the entity will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The objective of the Group is to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet commitments under normal and stressed conditions.

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities. Due to the lack of material revenue, the Group aims at maintaining flexibility in funding by maintaining adequate reserves of liquidity.

The Group did not have access to any undrawn borrowing facilities at the reporting date. All liabilities are current and will be repaid in normal trading terms.

## (a) Contractual Maturities

The following are the contractual maturities of financial assets and liabilities of the Group:

|   | Within 1 Year |  | Greater Than 1 Year |  | Total |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   | 2022 | 2021 | 2022 | 2021 | 2022 | 2021  |
|  Financial liabilities due for payment |  |  |  |  |  |   |
|  Trade and other payables | 396,281 | 115,458 | - | - | 396,281 | 115,458  |
|  Total contractual outflows | 396,281 | 115,458 | - | - | 396,281 | 115,458  |
|  Financial assets |  |  |  |  |  |   |
|  Cash and cash equivalents | 4,148,992 | 553,795 | - | - | 4,148,992 | 553,795  |
|  Other receivables | 292,322 | 61,229 | - | - | 292,322 | 61,229  |
|  Total anticipated inflows | 4,441,314 | 615,024 | - | - | 4,441,314 | 615,024  |
|  Net inflow on financial instruments | 4,045,033 | 499,566 | - | - | 4,045,033 | 499,566  |

It is not expected that the cash flows included in the maturity analysis could occur significantly later or at significantly different amounts.

### 8.2.4 Cash flow and interest rate risk

From time to time the Group has significant interest-bearing assets, but they are as a result of the timing of equity raising and capital expenditure rather than a reliance on interest income. The interest rate risk arises on the rise and fall of interest rates. The Group's income and operating cash flows are not expected to be materially exposed to changes in market interest rates in the future and the exposure to interest rates is limited to the cash and cash equivalents balances. As such, this is not considered a material exposure and no sensitivity analysis has been prepared.

The Group's exposure to interest rate risk, which is the risk that a financial instrument's value will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates and the effective weighted average interest rates on classes of financial assets and financial liabilities, is below.

AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement: Disclosures requires disclosure of the fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy:

- Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;
- Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); and
- Level 3 - inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs)

All financial assets are classified as Level 1 and their value has been calculated in line with accounting policy note 24.8 Fair Value.

## NOTE 9 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

The Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, so that they may continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to equity holders of the parent comprising issued capital, reserves and accumulative losses.

Due to the nature of the Group's activities, being mineral exploration, the Group does not have ready access to credit facilities, with the primary source of funding being equity raisings. Therefore, the focus of the Group's capital risk management is the current working capital position against the requirements of the Group to meet exploration programs and corporate overheads. The Group's strategy is to ensure appropriate liquidity is maintained to meet anticipated operating requirements, with a view to initiating appropriate capital raisings as required.

The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements. The working capital position of the Group at 30 June 2022 and 30 June 2021 is as follows:

|   | Note | 2022 | 2021  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Note 11 Asset Acquisition

### 11.1 EF Niger Exploration SARL

On 24 May 2022, the Company has completed the 100\% acquisition of the Agadez Project in Niger ("Agadez" or the "Project") following the Company entering into a binding share sale agreement (ASX Release - 9 December 2021) with Endeavour Finance AG ("Endeavour"), via the acquisition of Endeavour's wholly owned subsidiary EF Niger Exploration SARL (EF Niger).

No goodwill will arise on the acquisition and transaction costs of the acquisition will be included in the capitalised cost of the asset.

- Exploration assets
- Cash
- Other intangible assets
- Payables

Net assets at completion

### 13.4 Accounting policy

An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity but is not control or joint control of those policies. Investments in associates are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements by applying the equity method of accounting, whereby the investment is initially recognised at cost (including transaction costs) and adjusted thereafter for the postacquisition change in the Group's share of net assets of the associate. In addition, the Group's share of the profit or loss of the associate is included in the Group's profit or loss.

The carrying amount of the investment includes, when applicable, goodwill relating to the associate. Any discount on acquisition, whereby the Group's share of the net fair value of the associate exceeds the cost of investment, is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.

Profits and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the associate.

When the Group's share of losses in an associate equal or exceed its interest in the associate, the Group discontinues recognising its share of further losses unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. Upon the associate subsequently making profits, the Group will resume recognising its share of those profits once its share of the profits equals the share of the losses not recognised.

Potential shares as a result of options outstanding at the end of the year are not dilutive and therefore have not been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.

| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: |

| Value per option: | $\$ 0.0211$ | $\$ 0.0128$ | $\$ 0.0153$ |

The expected life of the option is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcomes.

### 21.3.1 Accounting Policy

The Group provides benefits to employees (including senior executives) of the Group in the form of share-based payments, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (equity-settled transactions).

The cost of these equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair value is determined by using a Black-Scholes model.

In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of Kopore (market conditions) if applicable.

The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (the vesting period).

The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each balance date until vesting date reflects (i) the extent to which the vesting period has expired and (ii) the Group's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. No adjustment is made for the likelihood of market performance conditions being met as the effect of these conditions is included in the determination of fair value at grant date. The statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.

No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is only conditional upon a market condition.

If the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified. In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee, as measured at the date of modification.

If an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new award are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.

### 21.3.2 Key Estimate - Share-based payments

The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions by reference to the fair value of the equity instrument at the date at which they are granted. The fair value of options granted is measured using either the Binomial or Black-Scholes option pricing model. The model uses assumptions and estimates as inputs. The assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in note 21.2 and 21.3.

## NOTE 22 SEGMENT REPORTING

### 22.1 Identification of reportable segments

The Group has identified its operating segments based on the internal reports that are reviewed and used by the Board of Directors (chief operating decision makers) in assessing performance and determining the allocation of resources.

The Group is managed primarily on the basis of business category and geographical areas. Operating segments are therefore determined on the same basis.

Reportable segments disclosed are based on aggregating operating segments where the segments are considered to have similar economic characteristics. The Group considers that it has only operated in one segment, being the exploration business.

### 22.2 Basis of accounting for purposes of reporting by operating segments

22.2.1 Accounting policies adopted

The accounting policies used by the Group in reporting segments are in accordance with the measurement principles of Australian Accounting Standards.

### 22.2.2 Inter-segment transactions

All such transactions are eliminated on consolidation of the Group's financial statements. Inter-segment loans payable and receivable are initially recognised at the consideration received/to be received net of transaction costs. If inter-segment loans receivable and payable are not on commercial terms, these are not adjusted to fair value based on market interest rates. This policy represents a departure from that applied to the statutory financial statements.

### 22.2.3 Segment assets

During the year ended 30 June 2022 and 30 June 2021, all assets were in the same business segment, which is the Group's exploration business.

These financial statements are general purpose financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AAS Board) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).

Australian Accounting Standards (AASBs) set out accounting policies that the AAS Board has concluded would result in a financial report containing relevant and reliable information about transactions, events and conditions to which they apply. Compliance with AASBs ensures that the financial statements and notes also comply with IFRS as issued by the IASB.

The financial statements were authorised for issue on 28 September 2022 by the Directors of the Company.

### 24.1.3 Going Concern

The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis that contemplates the continuity of normal business activities and the realisation of assets and extinguishment of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.

As disclosed in the financial statements, the Group incurred a loss for the year of $\$ 4,542,384$ (2021: $\$ 1,243,075$ loss) and a net cash out-flow from operating activities of $\$ 2,320,689$ (2021: $\$ 1,114,491$ out-flow).

The Directors believe that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Group will be able to continue as a going concern and that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in the preparation of the financial report, after consideration of the following factors:

- the Group is in a net current asset position of $\$ 4,059,808$ at year end, which is considered sufficient to meet its liabilities as and when they become due and payable;
- the Group has the ability to curtail its exploration activities in order to conserve cash; and
- the Group has the ability to raise further funds through capital raisings as and when required as it has successfully achieved in the past.


### 24.1.4 Comparative Figures

Where required by AASBs comparative figures have been adjusted to conform to changes in presentation for the current financial year.

Where the Group retrospectively applies an accounting policy, makes a retrospective restatement or reclassifies items in its financial statements, an additional (third) statement of financial position as at the beginning of the preceding period in addition to the minimum comparative financial statements is presented.

## NOTE 24 STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT.)

### 24.2 Principles of Consolidation

As at reporting date, the assets and liabilities of all controlled entities have been incorporated into the consolidated financial statements as well as their results for the year then ended. Where controlled entities have entered (left) the Group during the year, their operating results have been included (excluded) from the date control was obtained (ceased).

### 24.2.1 Subsidiaries

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities and results of the parent, ENRG Elements Limited (formerly known as Kopore Metals Limited), and all of the subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities the parent controls. The parent controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has right to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. A list of the subsidiaries is provided in Note 10.

The assets, liabilities and results of all subsidiaries are fully consolidated into the financial statements of the Group from the date on which control is obtained by the Group. The consolidation of a subsidiary is discontinued from the date that control ceases. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains or losses on transactions between group entities are fully eliminated on consolidation. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed and adjustments made where necessary to ensure uniformity of the accounting policies adopted by the Group.

Equity interests in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Group are presented as non-controlling interests. The Group initially recognises non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests in subsidiaries and are entitled to a proportionate share of the subsidiary's net assets on liquidation at either fair value or at the non-controlling interests' proportionate share of the subsidiary's net assets. Subsequent to initial recognition, non-controlling interests are attributed their share of profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income. Non-controlling interests are shown separately within the equity section of the statement of financial position and statement of comprehensive income.

### 24.3 Discontinued operations

A discontinued operation is a component of the Group that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of such a line of business or area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The results of discontinued operations are presented separately on the face of the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.

### 24.4 Goods and Services Tax (GST)

Goods and Services Tax (GST) is the generic term for the broad-based consumption taxes that the Group is exposed to such as: Australia (Goods and Services Tax or GST) and in Botswana and Namibia (Value-added tax or VAT), hereafter collectively referred to as GST.

Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST, unless the GST incurred is not recoverable from the taxation authority. In this case it is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense.

Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included with other receivables or payables in the consolidated statement of financial position.

Cash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing or financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to the taxation authority, are presented as operating cash flow.

### 24.5 Foreign currency translation

The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is ENRG Elements Limited (formerly known as Kopore Metals Limited)'s functional and presentation currency.

### 24.5.1 Foreign currency transactions

Foreign currency transactions are translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at financial year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022

## NOTE 24 STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT.)

24.5.2 Foreign operations

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rates at the reporting date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the average exchange rates, which approximate the rates at the dates of the transactions, for the period. All resulting foreign exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income through the foreign currency reserve in equity.
The foreign currency reserve is recognised in profit or loss when the foreign operation or net investment is disposed of.

### 24.6 Current and non-current classification

Assets and liabilities are presented in the statement of financial position based on current and non-current classification. An asset is classified as current when: it is either expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the Group's normal operating cycle; it is held primarily for the purpose of trading; it is expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting period; or the asset is cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. All other assets are classified as non-current.

A liability is classified as current when: it is either expected to be settled in the Group's normal operating cycle; it is held primarily for the purpose of trading; it is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period; or there is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. All other liabilities are classified as non-current.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always classified as non-current.

### 24.7 Use of estimates and judgments

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
Judgements made by management in the application of AASBs that have significant effect on the consolidated financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in 24.7.1.

### 24.7.1 Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements

Judgements, estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The Group makes assumptions concerning the future. All judgements, estimates and assumptions made are believed to be reasonable based on the most current set of circumstances available to management. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The judgements, estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts and assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.

- Key estimate - Taxation (refer note 4.4)
- Key estimate - Impairment (refer note 6.2.3)
- Key judgments - Exploration and evaluation expenditure (refer note 6.2.4)
- Key estimate - Share-based payments (refer note 21.3.2)


### 24.7.2 Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic

Judgement has been exercised in considering the impacts that the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had, or may have, on the Group based on known information. This consideration extends to the nature of the supply chain, staffing and geographic regions in which the Group operates. Other than as addressed in specific notes, there does not currently appear to be either any significant impact upon the financial statements or any significant uncertainties with respect to events or conditions which may impact the Group unfavourably as at the reporting date or subsequently as a result of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022

## Note 24 STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

24.8 Fair Value
24.8.1 Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities

The Group measures some of its assets and liabilities at fair value on either a recurring or non-recurring basis, depending on the requirements of the applicable AASB.

Fair value is the price the Group would receive to sell an asset or would have to pay to transfer a liability in an orderly unforced transaction between independent, knowledgeable and willing market participants at the measurement date.

As fair value is a market-based measure, the closest equivalent observable market pricing information is used to determine fair value. Adjustments to market values may be made having regard to the characteristics of the specific asset or liability. The fair values of assets and liabilities that are not traded in an active market are determined using one or more valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise, to the extent possible, the use of observable market data.

To the extent possible, market information is extracted from either the principal market for the asset or liability (i.e. the market with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset or liability) or, in the absence of such a market, the most advantageous market available to the entity at the end of the reporting period (i.e. the market that maximises the receipts from the sale of the asset or minimises the payments made to transfer the liability, after taking into account transaction costs and transport costs).

For non-financial assets, the fair value measurement also considers a market participant's ability to use the asset in its highest and best use or to sell it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

The fair value of liabilities and the entity's own equity instruments (excluding those related to share-based payment arrangements) may be valued, where there is no observable market price in relation to the transfer of such financial instruments, by reference to observable market information where such instruments are held as assets. Where this information is not available, other valuation techniques are adopted and, where significant, are detailed in the respective note to the financial statements.

### 24.8.2 Fair value hierarchy

AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement requires the disclosure of fair value information by level of the fair value hierarchy, which categorises fair value measurements into one of three possible levels based on the lowest level that an input that is significant to the measurement can be categorised into as follows:

## Level 1

Measurements based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.

## Level 2

Measurements based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

## Level 3

Measurements based on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

The fair values of assets and liabilities that are not traded in an active market are determined using one or more valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise, to the extent possible, the use of observable market data. If all significant inputs required to measure fair value are observable, the asset or liability is included in Level 2. If one or more significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the asset or liability is included in Level 3.

The Group would change the categorisation within the fair value hierarchy only in the following circumstances:

- if a market that was previously considered active (Level 1) became inactive (Level 2 or Level 3) or vice versa; or
- if significant inputs that were previously unobservable (Level 3) became observable (Level 2) or vice versa.

When a change in the categorisation occurs, the Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy (i.e. transfers into and out of each level of the fair value hierarchy) on the date the event or change in circumstances occurred.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022

## Note 24 STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT.)

24.8 Fair Value (cont.)
24.8.3 Valuation techniques

The Group selects a valuation technique that is appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value. The availability of sufficient and relevant data primarily depends on the specific characteristics of the asset or liability being measured. The valuation techniques selected by the Group are consistent with one or more of the following valuation approaches:

- Market approach: valuation techniques that use prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions for identical or similar assets or liabilities.
- Income approach: valuation techniques that convert estimated future cash flows or income and expenses into a single discounted present value.
- Cost approach: valuation techniques that reflect the current replacement cost of an asset at its current service capacity.

Each valuation technique requires inputs that reflect the assumptions that buyers and sellers would use when pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risks. When selecting a valuation technique, the Group gives priority to those techniques that maximise the use of observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs that are developed using market data (such as publicly available information on actual transactions) and reflect the assumptions that buyers and sellers would generally use when pricing the asset or liability are considered observable, whereas inputs for which market data is not available and therefore are developed using the best information available about such assumptions are considered unobservable.
24.9 New Accounting Standards and Interpretations not yet mandatory or early adopted

Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 30 June 2022 reporting periods and have not been early adopted by the Group. These standards are not expected to have a material impact on the entity in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.

## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial report is located at the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board website at: https://www.auasb.gov.au/auditors responsibilities/a2.pdf. This description forms part of our auditor's report.
